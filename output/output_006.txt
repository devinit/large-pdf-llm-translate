The projected significant structural transformation in industry and service sector is expected to continue under the directive of the plan. The contribution of the primary sector to the total GDP is estimated to decline from 24.6 percent to 21.4 percent. The contribution of the secondary sector is projected to grow from 12.5 percent to 15.2 percent. It is anticipated that the contribution of the service sector will increase from 62.9 percent to 63.4 percent. This shows that the share of the secondary sector may increase at the expense of the primary sector, while substantial labor from the agriculture sector moves towards the industry and services sectors. The contribution structure of GDP has been elaborated in Table 2.3.

(i) Impact on the Gross Domestic Product: The projected growth rate of the GDP is estimated to have a significant growth in the per capita income of Nepalese people as the growth scenario remains with the ongoing population growth projection estimated based on the fiscal year plan. It is anticipated that the projected gross domestic product for the fiscal year plan will reach approximately NPR 3 trillion 31 billion, or 2319 American dollars. Accordingly, the projected income is estimated to reach 2351 American dollars.

(c) Marginal Capital Output Ratio and Investment: The planned fiscal year will significantly maintain economic growth through investments from the public, private and cooperative sectors as a result of the economic growth focused on rational structural transformation. It is projected that there will be considerable capital formation and an increase in employment opportunities. In this year, the productivity activities will be implemented within the targeted environment that is a distinction from previous activities. The preliminary proposals regarding capital formation and investment will also see transformations under the plan. Existing initiatives concerning investment in this plan will be completed and operationalized. Significant growth can be attributed from the public sector projects run collaboratively between the federal, provincial and local governments under different initiatives.
