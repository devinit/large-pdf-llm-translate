58 | Sixteenth Plan (fiscal year 2081/82 - 2085/86) (g) Long-term source management of investment: The plan has estimated a total investment of Rs. 94 billion 82 crore (at the price of fiscal year 2080/81). The required funding will come from government and cooperative financial institutions and non-government sources. Since investment from traditional sources is insufficient, new alternative sources have been identified, which will be managed accordingly. Traditional sources will include government revenue, foreign aid, cooperative loans, and share capital from non-government sources, while alternative sources will involve foreign investment, public-private partnerships, official investments, project development loans, income flows from natural resource endowments, green industry management, climate financing, carbon taxes, and various public financial institutions.  
(h) Consumption, savings, and capital formation: Since total savings and national consumption determine the capital formation ratio, the sixteenth plan aims to significantly increase total capital formation while encouraging savings by cutting unnecessary consumption. The plan estimates a ratio of savings to total output at 91.5% and 8.2% respectively. Total national savings is targeted to reach 39.0% of total output. Similarly, total capital formation is estimated to be maintained at 28.6% of total output. The share of government investment in total capital formation is expected to be 30.2% and that of non-government sources (including cooperatives) will be 69.8%.

2.6.2 Government Revenue  
According to the plan's framework, good governance, social equity, and sustainable growth are crucial for public finance management. This framework focuses on managing internal revenue to create jobs and overall productivity improvements, enabling the government to maintain discipline and efficiency in public finance management. The plan estimates that Rs. 120 billion 63 crore will be generated from government sources. Out of this, Rs. 45 billion 71 crore will be current revenue, Rs. 27 billion 71 crore will come from capital revenue, Rs. 22 billion 57 crore will be revenue from capital arrangements, and Rs. 24 billion 62 crore will be derived from capital transfers (grants). It is estimated that the key source of government revenue will be the federal revenue, contributing Rs. 84 billion 65 crore. Total divisible revenue is projected to be around Rs. 95 billion 30 crore.   
The plan predicts Rs. 17 billion 52 crore from foreign aid. The total estimated revenue and foreign aid expected to be generated from the plan is around Rs. 18 billion 42 crore, which will be utilized for internal loans. The contributions of public finance are explained in detail in Table 2.8.

62 | Sixteenth Plan (Fiscal Year 2081/82 - 2085/86) The plan targets to generate 21.4% of total GDP from federal revenues. Similarly, it is estimated that federal revenues and capital transfers combined will maintain ratios of 26.4% and 8.0% respectively. The remaining public debt will be aimed at reaching appropriate ratios between total GDP and public expenditure at 39.0%.

2.6.3 Monetary and Fiscal Policy  
The sixteenth plan will implement strategies to improve monetary and fiscal policies for sustainable economic growth and stability. It aims to maintain inflation at around 5.0% in the current environment and control the fiscal deficit at around 13%. The plan expects liquidity growth in the banking and financial institutions sector to reach around 14%. The goal set for the percentage of households with access to banks and financial institutions is 80%.

2.6.4 External Revenue  
Indicative indicators related to external revenue during the period of the sixteenth plan show a mix of optimistic prospects. The expected liquidity management will further strengthen these indicators, even though some external trade indicators are currently unclear. Various strategies will be implemented to reduce the trade deficit and better manage revenues and expenditures from trade agreements. The plan estimates the trade deficit (both goods and services) to be maintained at around 22.5% of total GDP. The contribution of foreign investment and income (goods and services) is targeted to reach 8.5% and 31.0% respectively. Similarly, projections suggest that net foreign direct investment will reach Rs. 200 billion, along with income from service sectors totaling Rs. 7 billion.

2.6.5 Informal and Alternative Economy  
Given the significant role of the informal economy in the countryâ€™s economy, issues related to resource management and liquidity will be addressed in the plan to formalize the economy. The liquidity management strategies will focus on eliminating illegal trade, smuggling, and unauthorized transactions, enhancing effective regulation of the informal economy. It is estimated that around 85% of institutions will be operating legally and about 88% of them will be keeping transaction records. As the economy becomes more formal, it is expected that the number of newly registered taxpayers will reach around 80,000.
