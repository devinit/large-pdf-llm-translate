Quality Infrastructure Development and Intensive Internal-Urban Planning

(1) Promotion of alternative energy sources (excluding hydroelectric power): Develop necessary master plans for encouraging renewable energy such as solar energy, wind energy, and hydrogen energy.
(2) Integration of hydropower: Prioritize hydropower development through the establishment of strategic measurements and project planning; manage hydropower as a strategic resource for the operation of the economy; balance the demand and supply of energy during peak hours with transformative multi-purpose projects using reservoirs.
(3) Multi-purpose water resource management: Establish comprehensive management and identification systems for water resources based on river basin plans, including the identification and conservation of groundwater sources, while establishing river basin management structures, water allocation, and utilization oversight.
(4) Innovative management of water use: Promote innovative practices in water diplomacy; collaborate with regulatory bodies for sustainable management of multi-purpose and reservoir projects; utilize technology in agriculture, particularly in regions lacking irrigation potential, utilizing methods such as cluster irrigation, deep tube wells, and lift irrigation with optimal and innovative practices.
(5) Integrated river basin management: Identify resources for developing a unified system that addresses local needs, reduces negative impacts on the economy and environmental balance, and ensure developments are resilient to climate change and its effects.
(6) Waste management: Implement local waste management initiatives by establishing management systems that engage all water sources.
(7) Communication and information technology enhancement: Improve telecommunication networks to facilitate access to reliable, efficient, and transparent services; enhance digital infrastructures through the development of a public-private partnership system.
(8) Construction of an optimal, expansive cyber space: Enhance existing information infrastructure to include secure and resilient cyberspace; establish laws regarding data governance and promote a science-centered approach to information management.
(9) Postal service infrastructure development and modernization: Establish effective service operational strategies and enhance existing postal infrastructure for broader reach and efficiency.
(10) Material management in construction: Foster easy access to construction materials by identifying production sites, improving inventory, and managing material delivery systems.
(11) Housing and urban infrastructure development: Create urban and rural housing plans catering to the needs of vulnerable groups, elderly citizens, and people with disabilities; improve the accessibility and quality of healthcare resources.
(12) Convergence of production and productivity improvement: Enhance projects linking infrastructure and productivity; maximize the utilization of traditional knowledge, skills, and practices in natural and human capital to improve overall economic output.
(13) Development of sustainable tourism infrastructure: Promote Nepal as an attractive international tourism destination by enhancing aesthetic and cultural values.
(14) Management of hydropower projects: Develop national-scale hydropower projects through the shared and non-resident Nepali investments from the economic diaspora.
(15) Integrated river basin irrigation and water management: Implement irrigation systems in areas with irrigation gaps and ensure effective water management.
(16) Improvement of information technology infrastructure: Strengthen the application and execution of the national IT framework, focusing on 5G and broadband advancements.
(17) Construct public-private partnerships in the sustainable printing industry: Restructure the printing sector to enhance productivity and sustainability while meeting market needs.
(18) Development of international film tourism destinations: Position Nepal as a prime film tourism destination through public-private partnerships.
(19) Restructuring and transforming postal services: Engage with local communities to enhance postal services under a "One Locality, One Smart Postal Service" initiative.
(20) Identification and conservation of natural resources: Initiate programs aimed at conserving significant natural landmarks and water bodies while promoting public awareness regarding the sustainable use of these resources.
(21) Decentralized urban development and safe road construction: Identify and enhance urban infrastructures in provincial cities; improve road safety measures and transportation systems.
(22) Scientific enhancement of water and meteorological forecasting: Develop robust water management systems, including early warning systems for flood and drought predictions.
(23) Integrated irrigation development: Implement prioritization of lift irrigation, groundwater management, and river corridor irrigation to enhance agricultural productivity; establish sustainable practices for water conservation.
