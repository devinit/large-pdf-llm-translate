Article 10
Poverty Alleviation and Inequality Reduction and Building an Inclusive Society 
10.1 Background
The government of Nepal has envisioned an inclusive society through the abolition of all forms of discrimination based on class, caste, ethnicity, religion, gender, and all kinds of gender segregation; affording economic equality, prosperity, and social justice as the foundational basis for collective participation and social growth. Essential services like education, housing, employment and social security have been established as fundamental rights. With the adoption of a federal governance structure, the aim is to eliminate all forms of discrimination and oppression within society and ensure economic equality, prosperity, and social justice. Furthermore, the long-term vision aims to eradicate poverty by 2100 and targets to diversify poverty reduction strategies in a holistic way. 
In conjunction with development planning, strategies for reducing poverty and inequality have been integrated. Various national and global efforts towards poverty alleviation have focused on effective participation and collaboration. Despite significant efforts, gaps in achieving the target poverty alleviation goals have highlighted the continued urgency to effectively respond to all forms of inequalities present in society. Transformational efforts are necessary to create a truly inclusive society by ensuring equal access to economic, social, and institutional opportunities.

10.2 Current Status
The government-led initiatives have shown progress in terms of poverty alleviation and inequality reduction. According to the Fourth Living Standards Survey, 2022, 20.3 percent of the total population of Nepal is living in poverty, with the urban poverty rate at 18.3 percent and rural poverty at 24.7 percent. Among the provinces, Karnali and Sudurpaschim have been recognized as having a higher poverty rate compared to the national average. Significant disparities exist in economic, social, geographic, gender, and caste metrics. Provinces like Bagmati and Gandaki hold relatively lower poverty levels compared to others. Multidimensional poverty indicators also reflect a concerning state, with Karnali province exhibiting a poverty rate of 39.5 percent while Bagmati stands at a mere 7 percent. 

The ratio of vulnerable communities represented in government machinery remains inadequate against the targeted sustainable development efforts. Additionally, the Gender Inequality Index demonstrates persistent inequality across all regions. Despite initiatives undertaken, local community representation in governance mechanisms needs further enhancement to achieve inclusive growth. 

10.3 Key Issues and Challenges
(1) Mapping and targeting poverty: There is a need to identify vulnerable households and establish targeted interventions addressing geographical disparities to effectively tackle poverty.
