Prime Minister's Statement  
The Sixteenth Plan has been prepared in a timely manner to guide the economic, social, and environmental development of the country. With the establishment of a federal democratic republic, the focus of political leadership has now shifted towards economic development and prosperity. Since the establishment of the three-tiered government, activities for economic, social, and infrastructure development have been increasing. The professional skills and entrepreneurial spirit of businesses have been developing.  
In the context of 67 years of planning and development efforts, significant milestones have been achieved in the areas of economic, social, and infrastructure development through various efforts. However, despite these achievements, when compared to the existing needs of the country for development, the expectations of citizens, and the available resources and possibilities, our achievements appear overall to be insufficient. The goals that need to be achieved in accordance with the ongoing national development priorities cannot be successfully pursued if we continue with the traditional processes of planning and implementation. In this regard, it is necessary to create an environment for achieving the goals outlined in the current plan by providing new direction to the development practices we have been adopting so far.

The geographic location of the country, its unique natural features and society, the aspirations and demands of the citizens, the good relations initiated in international cooperation, and the need for coordinated development among various sectors of the state and society, all require strong support for good governance, prosperity, and justice, which remains a primary focus for effective implementation of the plan.  
Therefore, in order to make the plan ambitious and ensure effective implementation, it requires continuous collaboration among the state's various official entities.  
In the pursuit of inclusive development, this Sixteenth Plan is aimed at structural transformation that will usher in a new chapter in the country's overall development. To ensure that Nepal is a developing and prosperous country by 2026 and reaches the status of a middle-income country, the plan anticipates the realization of sustainable development goals by 2030, effective reduction of poverty and unemployment, and increasing access to services such as education, health, and social security for marginalized citizens.  
Ultimately, this Sixteenth Plan aims to bring about a positive change in the lives of ordinary citizens. Expressing gratitude to all who have been involved in the formulation of this plan, especially the National Planning Commission, I urge all stakeholders to actively participate in its implementation.  
Thank you.

Statement  
Nepal has been implementing planning for development for about half a century. During this period, ten five-year plans and five annual plans have been formulated and implemented. Based on a long-term vision for "Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepalis," the implementation of the Tenth Plan is expected to conclude by this economic year 2080/81, thus the Sixteenth Plan has been formulated to carry out implementation from the economic year 2081/82 to 2085/86. This plan envisions "good governance, social justice, and prosperity" and has established objectives and comprehensive strategies to promote equitable growth. The plan identifies the crucial issues and challenges that hinder our development and prosperity.

Among the various objectives of previous plans, progress has been satisfactory in social indicators, while the economic growth objectives and outcomes have shown significant disparities. Past plans faced long intervals for implementation; the Fourth Plan's social sector targets coupled with economic growth objectives reveal ongoing disparities. The Tenth Plan's implementation had challenges, including external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which adversely affected the achievement of its goals and targets. The experiences and learnings from previous plans have been integrated into the Sixteenth Plan.

This Sixteenth Plan has been designed to ensure its implementation is feasible, realistic, and result-oriented while guiding the overall direction of national development. The plan addresses the structural barriers affecting various dimensions and is aligned with transformational strategies and key programs incorporated within it. Additionally, the plan emphasizes the importance of strengthening the engagement of all relevant stakeholders in its implementation, and it aims to mainstream inclusivity across all dimensions of development, promote sustainable practices, and mitigate risks while enhancing evidence-based decision-making and implementation.

In creating this Sixteenth Plan, we acknowledge the invaluable guidance received from the honorable Prime Minister and the commission's chairperson. Similarly, we express our deeply felt gratitude to the government, political parties, development actors, civil society, non-governmental organizations, and development partners for their support and valuable suggestions provided during the plan's formulation. Furthermore, I would like to extend special thanks to members and staff of the National Planning Commission for their continued engagement in this plan's development.
