Productive Employment, Migrant Labor, and Social Protection
4.1 Background
The Constitution of Nepal has guaranteed the rights of social protection and labor and employment in accordance with dignified living. The productivity of labor ensures that productive employment, decent work, and social protection are maintained through effective management and productivity enhancement, aiming to reduce risks to human life, rapid economic growth, and inclusive development of social justice by contributing towards national goals. The development strategy aims to generate secure jobs and promote sustainable livelihoods, providing equal pay for equal work, social security, establishing decent work relationships, respecting labor and workers, ending all forms of labor exploitation, ensuring labor rights, and implementing occupational health and safety measures. It is essential to utilize the demographic dividends available in the country by aligning with the needs of the labor market to create innovative, skilled, mobile, competitive, and service-oriented manpower, which contributes to national production and productivity enhancement.

The current situation regarding the development strategy involves facilitating productive employment, establishing harmonious relations between workers and entrepreneurs, expanding the scope of social security, and utilizing the skills, capital, and experience gained from migrant employment domestically. The Constitution has enshrined the rights to employment, social protection, and labor as fundamental human rights. The International Labor Organization’s conventions have emphasized decent and secure employment, universal social protection, and productivity of labor rights. Legislative measures for managing both domestic and international labor include the Bonus Act-2076, Trade Union Act-2049, Foreign Employment Act-2064, Employment Rights Act-2075, Social Security Act-2074, Labor Act-2074, National Employment Policy-2071, and Foreign Employment Policy-2068 have been implemented. Timely amendments to these laws and policies have provided new directions. Additionally, measures have been taken to enhance the management of domestic job creation by eliminating forced migration for foreign employment and attracting domestic job opportunities.

According to the National Census 2078, the population structure of Nepal reflects that the productive age (15-59 years) group accounts for 67 percent. This demographic dividend is expected to remain until 2103. In the past decade, there has been a significant shift towards international labor migration from the domestic labor market, which has been marked by falling demand for domestic workers, an imbalance in labor demand and supply, and a decline in respect for labor culture. The unemployment rate stands at 11.4 percent, with 36.5 percent of the labor force engaged in formal employment. The participation rate of the working-age population is at 38.5 percent. Recent statistics indicate that informal labor sectors are six times larger than those involved in formal employment. The dropout rate from education has also seen a significant increase, although notable efforts have been initiated to regulate informal employment, domestic work, and unregulated labor. The prevalence of child labor has generally been decreasing, yet about 11 lakh children aged 5-13 are still involved in domestic labor.

The government has launched a national master plan for the eradication of child labor, aiming to declare local areas free of child labor by implementing the national action plan for the years 2075-2085. As of the Fiscal Year 2079/80, a total of 14 local areas have been declared free of child labor. Ensuring the sustainability of social security systems, the number of formal workers identified for contributions is increasing. By the end of the fiscal year 2080, according to the National Economic Census 2075, of the 9 lakh 23 thousand 356 establishments registered in Nepal, 18,847 establishments and 12,80,888 workers were covered under the social security scheme.

The establishment of the unified national social security system in 2080 aims to enhance the coverage of social protection, ensuring that contributions are made while addressing the gradual increase in livelihood benefits. Labor force surveys indicate that about 15 percent of workers are included in the social security system. The target in the 15th Plan aims to achieve 60 percent coverage in the social security scheme, while it is estimated that 32 percent of this has been reached. Approximately 14.8 percent of the federal budget for social security has been allocated to 87 programs. Social security programs are being implemented by provincial governments and local authorities. This year, with an increasing focus on disaster management, collective efforts will be made to enhance the coverage of contributions to social protection. The establishment of a unified national social security structure will be a significant step forward.

There is a lack of integrated data on employment opportunities available in the labor market. The inability to match the labor supplied with the job opportunities available in the domestic labor market has prompted workers to seek employment abroad. In the fiscal year 2079/80, 771,327 Nepalese entered the foreign labor market as newly employed and re-employed workers. It is estimated that 57 percent of households rely on remittance income, amounting to approximately 12 billion Rupees. This amount accounts for about 23 percent of the total gross domestic product. The number of workers seeking foreign employment is steadily rising, resulting in an increase in social service demands.
