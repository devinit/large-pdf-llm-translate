Environmental Sustainability, Climate Change, and Green Economy  
13.1 Background  
A healthy society and sustainable development are fundamentally linked to environmental sustainability, pollution management, climate resilience, disaster risk reduction, and sustainable economic development. Proactive management of natural resources, sustainable utilization of forest products, environmental sustainability, energy transition, development of green infrastructure, and creating opportunities for sustainable livelihoods are necessary for Nepal. While climate change has emerged as a core issue for the global community, Nepal requires sustainable, inclusive, and environmentally sound practices to safeguard its natural resources.  
Nepal contributes minimally to the global greenhouse gas emissions that are the primary drivers of climate change. However, the late melting of snow, local air pollution, and pollutants from brick kilns, vehicular emissions, cooking stoves, biomass burning, and wildfires in Nepal and South Asian countries pose significant risks. The detrimental effects of climate change have now led to broader and more intense vulnerability across various sectors in Nepal. The country’s unique geographical location, reliance on monsoon rains, climate-sensitive livelihoods, and the global climate change regime heighten Nepal's vulnerability and risks. Most vulnerable to climate-induced shocks are marginalized communities, small farmers, Dalits, indigenous populations, and the elderly. Ensuring the right to a clean environment is imperative in addressing the core tenets of Nepal’s climate sensitivity in development management. By enhancing sustainable environmental governance and climate resilience, Nepal will serve as a prominent example in international forums.  
13.2 Current Status  
Climate-responsive indicators in Nepal indicate a continued increase in climate-related disasters like droughts and floods, along with an increase in the occurrence and intensity of rainfall. The rising temperatures have amplified hazards such as landslides, flooding, and droughts, exacerbating the impact on agricultural productivity, drinking water, and ecosystems.  
Increasing pollution in urban areas, particularly in Kathmandu Valley, has posed significant challenges to public health, endangering the right to a clean environment. Unauthorized urbanization, unmanaged industrial development, increasing forest fires, and chemical fertilizer usage have aggravated environmental contamination, impacting biodiversity and natural resources. Due to the degraded and polluted environment, the risks involved in solid waste management have also intensified. Many households still depend on firewood and other pollutants for cooking.  
Excessive exploitation of natural forests has led to a massive decline in forest resources due to the loopholes in existing legal frameworks. There is a lack of entrepreneurial incentives for forest conservation and issues with environmental assessments and logging permissions. Collaboration is lacking within community forestry management, and there exists a disconnect between federal and provincial forest management frameworks. Mining materials from rivers lead to location-specific flooding while mining stones and gravel for construction has increased risks of flooding around those extraction sites. Multiple questions concerning unsustainable practices, lack of environmental permits for buildings, and excessive charging of fines remain unresolved.  
Effective and sustainable management of natural resources seems crucial for the development of Nepal. Currently, about 23,000 community forest user groups collectively manage approximately 2.2 million hectares of forest land, accounting for 45% of Nepal's region, demonstrating recognized achievements on international platforms.
