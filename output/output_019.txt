**Strengthening Regional and Local Economies and Sustainable Economic Development**  

9.1 Background  
The country's transition from a unitary governance system to a federal system has significantly altered the structure and form of the national economy. Economic activities conducted by the federal government contribute to the empowerment of provincial and local economies, which in turn supports the national economy in being robust and resilient. The federal system commits to principles of economic equality, inclusiveness, and social justice while strengthening the sustainable economic development of provincial and local economies. By enhancing the effectiveness of the federal governance system, coordination and synergies among national, provincial, and local economies must be strengthened to further consolidate their integration with the national economy. By strengthening regional and local economies, the fulfillment of fundamental rights, inclusive economic development that reduces inequality, effective implementation of poverty alleviation strategies, environmental sustainability, climate adaptation, and sustainable development, human capital development, and local community participation must be addressed. 

The practice of the federal governance system has led to the identification of local resources, effective management, and the creation of opportunities based on innovative resources. Additionally, cooperation, collaboration, coordination, and mutual support among the federal, provincial, and local governments enhance the potential for economic activities and the mobilization of local economies toward contributing to a prosperous national economy. The legal framework governing economic activities and revenue management has been structured to provide clear rights regarding taxation and revenue distribution, ensuring the economic empowerment of provincial and local economies. The goal is to utilize internal revenues effectively to support the national economy, and strategies based on established standards and indicators are being adopted to guide intergovernmental fiscal transfers.

In line with the spirit of federalism, significant enhancements have been made to the rights and responsibilities of provincial and local governments, along with mutual legal frameworks facilitating shared economic rights, resulting in enhanced economic development, equitable growth, and cohesion among the various levels of government. 

9.2 Current Situation  
The ongoing efforts for economic sustainability and equity in the context of resource and wealth distribution have been largely based on the adoption of the federal governance system; however, the objectives of enhancing the provincial and local economies have faced challenges. Despite the significant investments made by local governments, particularly in various sectors such as health, education, sanitation, and infrastructures, there continue to be socio-economic disparities among different provinces and localities. The focus is now shifting towards identifying and addressing the drivers of economic growth while ensuring that provincial and local governments engage in cooperative planning and management.

In the economic year 2079/80, the total agricultural production across the country was NRs 5.381 billion, with the Bagmati Province accounting for 36.9% of it. In contrast, Karnali Province was the lowest at only 4.1%. Moreover, Karnali and Sudurpashchim Provinces produced less than the eastern regions like Koshi, Lumbini, and Gandaki Provinces.

9.3 Main Issues and Challenges  
(1) Legislative and Structural Challenges: The effective implementation of economic responsibilities assigned to provincial and local governments, as mandated in the federal constitution, requires necessary attention. The oversight related to fiscal rights and economic policy requires coordination with the central government, and more defined laws and regulations must be addressed to provide comprehensive legal frameworks guiding economic activities. 

(2) Identification and Operation of Economic Agents: In the context of engaging governmental, non-governmental, cooperatives, and communities to foster local economic development, it is vital to ensure equity in the use of natural resources, address revenue distribution challenges, and identify essential economic sectors with high productivity.

(3) Production, Productivity and Competitive Viability: Boosting production and productivity requires addressing investment potential and barriers to growth through effective measures to enhance market accessibility and quality standards. 

(4) Quality and Viability of Public Resources: Fostering practical fiscal awareness and ensuring transparent distribution of resources aligns with identified needs and revenue requirements across provinces and local governments.

(5) Migration Management and Utilization of Human Capital: Addressing internal migration while maximizing geographic and demographic density can foster focused economic activities; each locality must strategically manage urbanization to capitalize on demographic advantages. 

(6) Strategies for Regional and Local Economic Viability: Aligning with prevailing economic conditions has potential by leveraging local production capabilities alongside traditional knowledge and skills. 

(7) Overall Development Standards and Internal Networking: Addressing disparities in provincial economic activity requires integrated approaches that enhance inter-province and inter-locality collaboration.

(8) National and International Initiatives for Sustainable Development: Coordinating efforts across various spheres of governance while considering international standards enables sustainable developmental goals targeting climate adaptation and social welfare.

9.4 Transformational Strategies  
(1) Long-term Policy Development and Effective Implementation: Aligning federal policies with provincial and local needs while ensuring transparent governance and accountability will enhance the operational viability of local economies.

(2) Strengthening Federal and Local Linkages: Solidifying legal and structural frameworks will promote collaborative governance, fostering grassroots participation in economic planning.

(3) Economic Diversification and Productivity Enhancement: Engaging in resource mapping and identifying economic opportunities at local levels will increase the resilience of regional economies.

(4) Empowering Socially Sustainable Economic Practices: Balancing the utilization of natural resources while enhancing human capital through appropriate policies is fundamental to economic stability.

(5) Effective Resource Management: Strengthening intergovernmental relations between various tiers of government will enhance the governance of local economies, particularly in resource management and revenue allocation.

(6) Ensuring Adequate Infrastructure and Human Resource Management: The establishment of effective governance frameworks will streamline processes, thereby maximizing human capital within local economies.

(7) Establishing Frameworks for Economic Collaboration: Fostering partnerships among provinces, local governments, and stakeholders through shared economic insights will propose relevant and effective frameworks for collaboration.

(8) Monitoring and Evaluation: Establishing robust metrics for assessing the performance of economic policies and practices at various tiers of government is crucial for ensuring accountability and driving development.
