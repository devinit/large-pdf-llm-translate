Introduction | 12th Plan (2067/68 - 2069/70) - The 12th plan aimed to create employment-focused, inclusive, and equitable economic growth, reduce poverty, establish a national education system, and enhance the overall experiences of the general public in their lives. This plan prioritized physical and social infrastructure development, job creation, economic growth, inclusion, good governance, and environmental sustainability. Under this framework, it set targets for thousand-year development goals, social indicators, employment generation, and revenue growth.

13th Plan (2070/71 - 2072/73) - The 13th plan aimed to elevate Nepalâ€™s status from a Least Developed Country to a developing country, decrease poverty, and improve the overall quality of life of the general public. This plan emphasized hydropower and energy development, agricultural productivity growth, diversification and commercialization, good governance practices, natural resources, environmental conservation, tourism, and industrial development. New indicators on inclusion, equitable distribution, telecommunication and mobile phone density, road mileage, and forest coverage were significantly highlighted.

14th Plan (2073/74 - 75/76) - With the initiation of the federal governance system, the 14th plan was the first to cover and approach such a structure. This plan aimed to build a welfare state ensuring social justice while reaching the status of a developing country through independence, prosperity, and socialism. The objective was to reduce poverty significantly through productive job creation and a high growth rate of the economy generated through substantial economic transformations. While it aimed for an average of 7.2% economic growth, actual growth reached about 7.4%. The plan integrated internal production and employment generation with the overall developmental framework, addressing national statistics and monetary policy harmonization.

15th Plan (2076/77 - 2080/81) - The 15th plan is highlighted with a long-term perspective to sustain the economy and ensure progress, including achieving targets over five years. It drew from the high economic growth rate projected in the 14th plan amid challenges caused by political instability, prolonged load-shedding in electricity and frequent strikes, showcasing a targeted average growth of 9.6% but only achieving 2.6% due to adverse effects from COVID-19 pandemic shocks that significantly affected various sectors and halted supply chains, reducing overall employment generation and productive efforts.

The implication of the COVID-19 pandemic was undeniable in damaging sectors such as tourism, hospitality, and informal employment. With lockdown measures, various businesses were strained, leading to a sharp decline in economic activities and unprecedented decreases in overall economic output, including a contraction of around 2.4% in the economic growth for the fiscal year 2076/77. The sectors affected included food production, agriculture, industry, and construction.

The impact of COVID-19 on domestic and foreign tourism led to significant challenges for the economy. The lockdown also indicated systemic failures in the supply chain and commercial enterprises. Nonetheless, the pandemic opened an opportunity for digital transactions, spurred by a shift towards increased online financing and remittance flows which improved ease of electronic payments.

The initial phases of the crisis showed a drop in consumption which gradually rebuilt as external economic pressures resulted in a surge in economic activities. However, substantial trade imbalances led to a slumping foreign currency reserve, forcing the government to reassess its economic policies strategically.

Post-pandemic, the economic growth projections indicated moderate recovery; nonetheless, structural reforms remained necessary due to existing weaknesses identified in sectors, resulting in widespread challenges such as high trade deficits, inconsistent monetary policies, and a growing current account deficit. All these complexities provide the foundation for future strategic planning aimed at sustainable long-term growth, thus informing the basis of the 16th Plan that would integrate previously unresolved structural barriers within various sectors of the economy while addressing essential societal needs equitably.

In summary, the overarching goals for the 16th Plan (2081/82 - 2085/86) revolve around robust frameworks centered on good governance, social justice, and inclusive growth driven by strategic planning, with an ultimate goal of prosperity for all citizens reflecting on 2100 long-term visions and objectives set forth. 

**Long-term Vision 2100** 
Through a long-term development strategy promoting equitable systems and addressing root causes of economic disparity and needs, the government synthesizes strategies that conclude with clear objectives that ensure holistic social and economic empowerment in a harmonious, democratic Nepal.
