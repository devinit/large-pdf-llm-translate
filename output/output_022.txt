Effective Public Financial Management and Capital Expenditure | 2075 Nepal's fiscal revenue management and its share in national government expenditure according to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) analysis between the economic years 2048/49 and 2075/76 shows that public capital expenditure has significantly decreased in 2079/80. The government's share of total capital expenditure continues to fluctuate with the consistent percentage of current and capital expenditure remaining at 11 percent in economic year 2048/49, which has significantly decreased to 4.4 percent in economic year 2079/80. It has become evident that the share of foreign grants in domestic capital investment is declining for effective public financial management while the share of internal debt is increasing. 

Structural issues remain in revenue collection. The contribution of indirect taxes to total revenue is considerably lower. With the current expenditure share in the overall budget increasing, capital expenditure planning and allocation have become increasingly critical. The share of capital expenditure is predominantly influenced by economic conditions and has become weaker in quality. The total structure of capital expenditure planning is constantly growing in size. Ineffective utilization of grant funding has led to the situation where the internal debt is being managed through public financial management.
