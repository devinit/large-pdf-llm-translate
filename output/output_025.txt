Jaistrawak Shtravastrivia, climate adaptation, and green economy. 237 Twenty ecological conservation units are contributing to the national economy through ecological environmental restoration. Forests and ecological units in Nepal hold high potential for environmental balance, ecological restoration, and climate adaptation through provisions of timber, herbal products, forest produce, and ecotourism. The in-country development has a plan to provide domestic clean energy by turning to electric vehicles as a result of increasing demand for four-wheeled vehicles powered by electricity rather than fossil fuels. Thus, Nepal has become a land of possibilities for creating alternative energy systems and concepts.

Nepal is a source of ecological restoration, climate adaptation through integrated federal management structures, major agreements like the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement. The National Climate Action Plan, 2076, and other legislative measures such as the Environmental Protection Act, 2076, and the Local Adaptation Framework, 2076, have been implemented, along with the Climate Change and Community Framework (2077-2087). The Second Nationally Determined Contribution and National Adaptation Plan is necessary for assessing these strategies. In this way, the National Climate Disaster Response and Risk Assessment Report, 2079, and the Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy, 2079, have been approved. Strategies prioritizing climate change mitigation and adaptation and targeted initiatives are being implemented.

In the fiscal year 2068/69, the national budget has been practicing climate indicators, and it has been decentralized to the province levels. Local climate adaptation strategies and plans have also been prepared, while about 263 local bodies are implementing the local adaptation plans. For the reduction and adaptation targets, a support agreement amounting to 87 million USD has been reached, besides three domestic institutions receiving approval for national support. Meanwhile, a deal worth 45 million USD has been struck with the World Bank for carbon trade.

Among two countries with large economies and populations, there is a distinct geographical and physical classification, natural beauty, forest and ecological systems, water resource availability, heritage and cultural assets, social and cultural values, and expressions are potential references for natural and inclusive economies.

238 | Sixteenth Plan (Fiscal Year 2081/82 - 2085/86) 13.3 Key Issues and Challenges
(1) Addressing water issues and institutional arrangements: Integrate ecological frameworks into environmental legislation, with climate adaptation and green business initiatives; given that environmental and climate issues are interrelated, institutions must establish a systemic coordination mechanism; promote the establishment of a dependable and required monitoring system for climate mitigation and adaptation nationally and globally to enhance international access to climate financing; prepare and implement ecological and community resource-development strategies; effectively implement the Nationally Determined Contributions and National Adaptation strategies in terms of monitoring and institutional coordination.
(2) Mitigating and adapting to climate impacts: Increase knowledge and awareness regarding the positive impacts of climate change on agriculture, water resources, health, tourism, energy, forestry, and ecological sectors; reduce the damages and losses caused by climate-induced disasters; enable coherence among climate adaptation strategies and budgets made by the Government of Nepal concerning international commitments; promote the production and consumption of clean renewable energy while phasing out dependency on fossil fuels.
(3) Internationalizing climate issues in Nepal: Unless large countries significantly reduce the use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions, Nepal will continue to face climate vulnerabilities and their impacts, requiring proactive engagement at international forums; emphasize the necessity for other countries to seriously reduce greenhouse gas emissions; ensure participation in relevant international forums realizing Nepal's necessities; lead by example in discussing climate issues with related nations; enhance Nepal's participation in international negotiations.
(4) Localizing climate issues: Locally integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies into national implementation frameworks; develop local adaptation strategies at all provincial and community levels; encourage local forest, environmental, ecological, and climate-based data collection and sharing systems; build adaptive capacities among local communities.
(5) Objective effectiveness measures: Reduce existing pollution in water, air, and soil based on scientific approaches; implement environmental impact assessments in income generation; adapt waste management to be organic and environmentally friendly; and increase community involvement in pollution source identification and management.
(6) Sustainable management of biodiversity and ecosystems: Effectively manage endangered and critically threatened species and plants; promote the preservation of habitats, food, and ecosystems; reduce human-wildlife conflicts; prevent water-related issues, such as water scarcity and groundwater depletion; reduce losses from natural calamities like floods; strengthen measures to prevent forest fires and illegal logging while establishing community involvement in conservation efforts; encourage local community participation in biodiversity management.
(7) Sustainable forest management: Ensure sustainable forest management practices that lead to market dependence on domestic timber supply, preventing excessive timber imports; promote responsible policies enhancing local forestry entrepreneurship; increase domestic reliance on forestry production and sustainably harvested timber; create a framework enhancing forest resource utilization efficiency in a socio-economic manner.
(8) Development of green economy: Identify green investment projects and facilitate investor engagement; increase Nepal's access to international climate funding; maximize engagement with national climate policies; encourage green resources while localizing frameworks for adaptation and mitigation measures tailormade to local economies; strengthen contributions to national economic productivity through ecology.
  
240 | Sixteenth Plan (Fiscal Year 2081/82 - 2085/86) 13.4 Transformative Strategies
(1) Encouraging climate-sensitive and inclusive development: Build houses and infrastructure that focus on environmentally sustainable and climate-sensitive investments; enhance adaptive capacities particularly for vulnerable communities; mainstream local adaptation actions across all provinces and communities; utilize indigenous knowledge, ecosystem services, and tradition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
(2) Internationalizing Nepal's climate issues: Positively raise Nepal's climate concerns at international platforms while ensuring continuous and inclusive international discussions on Nepal's climate vulnerabilities; actively promote collaboration toward leveraged frameworks for climate adaptation.
(3) Pollution management for a healthier society: Set standards for pollution emissions and monitoring across all sectors based on contemporary environmental metrics; enhance investments in clean energy and climate-friendly initiatives, focusing on community participation in pollution management.
(4) Collaborative and transparent forest management practices: Establish transparent and community-managed forest governance systems that involve local stakeholders; identify and implement measures to manage forest fires and illegal logging effectively; promote sustainable harvesting practices in line with biodiversity conservation principles.
(5) Climate risks and loss mitigation programs: Prepare for adaptive measures against climate-induced risks while restoring eco-friendly infrastructures; foster community resilience by implementing nature-based solutions alongside increasing awareness regarding climate change impacts.
(6) Local adaptation initiatives: Create localized adaptation plans in every local community while developing educational frameworks that incorporate cultural and ecological contexts; encourage adaptable techniques and practices suited to local ecosystems.
