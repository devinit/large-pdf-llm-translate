Building a healthy, skilled, and capable human capital  

**5.1 Background**  
Human capital significantly contributes to economic transformation and development. It derives from collective knowledge, skills, and abilities alongside health personnel. Investment in health, education, and sports promotes economic growth and social welfare. Nepal's constitution mandates guaranteeing health, education, and overall human life, leading to a basic structure in human capital development.  

Health impacts productivity and labor capacity throughout a personâ€™s life. Human capital development today not only addresses future necessities but also encourages current needs. Healthy parents provide a nurturing and healthy environment for their children. Health levels in the population contribute significantly to long-term economic harmony and transformation. In this context, ensuring accessible and quality health services is essential.  

Early childhood development initiatives ensure accessible, inclusive, quality, timely, and life-sustaining education. A skilled and competent workforce contributes to national growth. Education leads to economic prosperity, social progress, and knowledge creation and is vital for preparing a youthful workforce for national development.  

Physical fitness and organization lead to productive workers, the building of social and cultural capital, national and international identity, and play an important role for economic growth. Developing a system that incorporates skilled human resources, supporting economic viability, and growth is crucial.  

**5.2 Current Situation**  
At the end of the fiscal year 2079/80, health indicators such as mothers receiving antenatal care in accordance with protocols showed at least four visits, reaching about 80%, child vaccination rates reached 80%, and maternal mortality rate reached 151 deaths per 100,000 live births. The neonatal mortality rate and under-five mortality rate reached 21 and 33 per 1,000 live births, respectively. Child mortality and vaccination coverage for children under five have not been fully achieved. The increasing age of citizens has been accompanied by rising health issues, both temporary and chronic. Essential responses are needed to address health sector concerns using regulatory measures.  

In terms of higher education, there is gender parity concerning qualifications. According to the 2021 Census, the literacy rate among females aged 15 and above is 76.3%, while it is 92% for males in the age group 15-24. Gandaki, Bagmati, and Koshi provinces have been declared fully literate areas. Universities provide multiple learning pathways, but the literacy rate in primary education is around 94.9%, basic health literacy stands at 96.1%, and secondary (grades 9-12) literacy is at 57.4%. While these literacy rates are impressive, the dropout rates across educational levels remain concerning.  

Investment in higher education remains limited, thereby affecting necessary human resource output for the country's needs. The budgeting for research and educational projects continues to decline, impacting effective research development. Meanwhile, resources for productivity and innovation must be increased for sound national development.
