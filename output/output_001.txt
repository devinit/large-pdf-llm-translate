**Introduction**
1.1 Background
Through a series of long-term planning efforts spanning over a decade, Nepal has achieved significant milestones in economic, social and infrastructural development. This journey has seen the evolution of the political system and governance framework, which have been integrated into the periodic planning process to enhance the strategic vision, objectives, priorities and implementation of development plans systematically.

Nepalâ€™s vision aims to fulfill the aspirations of a federal democratic republic, which includes good governance, development and prosperity. It emphasizes the recognition of fundamental rights, enshrined in the constitution, and ensures economic justice and equality by designing a public management system that is proportional, inclusive and cooperative. The overarching economic goal of the state is to create an independent and progressive socialist economy with a robust, equitable and prosperous development framework. The long-term vision of 'Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali' has been established for developmental planning up to the year 2100.

Hence, through the institutional collaboration of public, private and cooperative sectors, the goal is to elevate Nepal to a developing country by 2026 (Fiscal Year 2083) while targeting sustainable development goals by 2030 (Fiscal Year 2087). The implementation of the recently initiated Fifth Plan (Fiscal Year 2076/77-2080/81) will conclude by the end of fiscal year 2081 and this Sixteenth Plan has been formulated to facilitate its implementation over the next five years (Fiscal Year 2081/82-2085/86).

1.2 Brief review of planning and development efforts
In the year 2013, the initiation of planning and development came to fruition with the establishment of the Planning Commission under the leadership of the Prime Minister, which issued the First Five-Year Plan (2013/14 - 2017/18) for implementation. From 2017 onwards, during the period of the Panchayat regime until 2046, the development of the second and other periodic plans were implemented. In 2046, following the restoration of multi-party democracy, an eight-tier federal system of governance was established and the implementation continued through the Eighth Plan (2049/50 - 2053/54) and Ninth Plan (2070/71 - 2072/73).

After the establishment of a federal democratic republic in 2072, the implementation of the Fourth Plan (2073/74 - 2075/76) began. Thereafter, new local and provincial governments were formed following elections, and the Fifth Plan (2076/77 - 2080/81) and individual provincial plans were implemented. Local authorities have also prepared their own periodic plans for implementation.

Three fiscal years: 2018/19, 2047/48 and 2048/49 were viewed as significant in terms of the implementation of periodic plans. The second and eleventh periodic plans and five more plans till the fourth have been implemented as five-year plans.

The Sixth Plan (2037/38-2041/42) emphasized rapid economic growth, the increase of productive employment, and the fulfillment of basic needs. It included strategies for the development of agriculture, small and medium enterprises, tourism, and the sustainable management of natural resources.

The Seventh Plan (2042/43-2046/47) aimed to continue the efforts from the Sixth Plan by focusing on increasing production and productivity and fulfilling basic community needs. It prioritized agriculture, forest resources, water resources, and the tourism sector for effective national economic integration.
