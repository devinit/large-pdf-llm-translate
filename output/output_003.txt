Strengthening of comprehensive economic foundations and 
high economic growth 
2.1 Background  
Strengthening of comprehensive economic foundations can lead to high and sustainable economic growth. Economic growth can contribute positively to human well-being and standards of living. Similarly, qualitative changes in human life enhance economic indices. Understanding the state and direction of a country's economic development requires a focus on comprehensive economic indicators.  
In the context of Nepal's development, the participation of public, private, and cooperative sectors, along with a socialist framework, aims to establish a balanced and inclusive economy. Moreover, the role of the private sector in promoting growth is highlighted, facilitating achievements through competitive resource utilization and equitable development throughout the country. Nepal aims to transition from least developed to developing country status by the fiscal year 2083 (2026). Additionally, the target is to achieve substantial development goals by the fiscal year 2087 (2030) and become a middle-income country. In this context, the strengthening of comprehensive economic foundations, robust economic growth, and social equity remains a priority under the Sixteenth Plan. 
2.2 Current status  
2.2.1 Economic growth  
Over the last three decades, the countryâ€™s average economic growth rate has been around 4.3 percent. The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has further affected the growth of an already vulnerable economy in recent years. In FY 2080/81, the economic growth rate is estimated at 3.5 percent (in real terms) with GDP per capita at USD 1456. The contribution of agriculture and productivity has not been sufficiently robust, leading to stagnant economic growth overall. In FY 2080/81, the estimated contribution of agriculture to total GDP was 24.1 percent and non-agriculture was 75.9 percent. Similarly, the contribution of the primary sector was estimated at 24.6 percent, the secondary sector at 12.5 percent, and the tertiary sector at 62.9 percent. Total consumption has shown some decline along with total national savings, indicating a situation where aggregate capital formation remains somewhat subdued. In FY 2080/81, total savings as a ratio of GDP was 7.6 percent and total national savings was 36.2 percent. The share of total capital formation as a percentage of total GDP stands at 24.5 percent.  
2.2.2 Government revenue  
In the fiscal year 2079/80, Nepal government's total revenue collection goal fell short by 68.2 percent, while total GDP was 17.9 percent. Similarly, the total revenue expenditure remained at 79.7 percent. The capital expenditure was only 21.2 percent of the total budget, whereas recurrent expenditure occupied 61.4 percent. The contraction of revenue, coupled with expected underperformance in external aid, has led to a major destabilization in public finances.  
In FY 2079/80, the foreign direct investment growth rate was negative at 22 percent, reflecting the overall difficulties in mobilizing external resources. Out of the total financing mix, grants accounted for 11.8 percent and loans for 23.3 percent. The low revenue situation necessitated increasing reliance on internal (domestic) borrowing. In FY 2079/80, 4.8 percent of total GDP was funded through internal borrowing, indicating that by the end of that year, the outstanding debts accounted for 43.0 percent of total GDP, with internal lending at 21.1 percent and external borrowing at 21.9 percent.  
With the adoption of a federal governance structure, three tiers of government have coordinated and collaborated in the public budget management and implementation. Local and provincial governments have significant roles in operationalizing public funds. The Nepal government has been allocating approximately 24 percent of the total fiscal budget to provincial and local governments. Additionally, revenue sharing and single-tier tax collection have facilitated local and provincial revenue collection under the federal budget framework. The need for effective internal resource mobilization and efficient revenue management in the coming days is underscored. 
Strengthening of comprehensive economic foundations and high economic growth | 25 2.2.3 Monetary and financial sectors and capital market  
During the initial years of the Fifteenth Plan, consumer price inflation was relatively low, but following the COVID-19 pandemic and other internal and external disturbances, the period saw some increase in prices. In FY 2079/80, the average national consumer price inflation was recorded at 7.7 percent. Money supply growth was at 11.4 percent and gross foreign reserves increased by 26.1 percent. In that year, total domestic credit rose by 8.7 percent, and the deposits of banks and financial institutions increased by 12.3 percent. The credit growth in the private sector rose by 3.8 percent. In Jaistha 2080, the average interbank lending rate was recorded at 6.4 percent. The average operating inter-bank rate was 3.1 percent as of Jaistha 2080.  
The lending rates of commercial banks averaged at 10.0 percent, while the weighted average lending rates from rural and cooperative banks were recorded at 7.9 percent and for microfinance institutions at 12.3 percent. As of the end of Jaistha 2080, the total number of banks and financial institutions reached 11,589. Accordingly, there is a ratio of one bank and financial institution to the total population of 25,173. The contribution of the financial sector, including non-banking financial institutions, continues to grow. Institutions such as savings and cooperatives, citizen investments, and consumer financing play crucial roles in expanding financial access, promoting investable capital, and maintaining financial stability.  
Insurance companies, as of the end of FY 2079/80, recorded a growth of 7.9 percent in life insurance and a 0.2 percent growth in non-life insurance. During this duration, the population covered by insurance reached 44.4 percent. In the capital market, the NEPSE index stood at 2097.1 as of Jaistha 2080. The number of listed companies on the Nepal Stock Exchange stood at 254, with a market capitalization of NPR 308.2 billion.  
2.2.4 External sector  
The trade deficit continues to persist in recent years. External reserves remain under pressure, contributing to the current account deficit. In FY 2079/80, the current account recorded a deficit of NPR 72.16 billion, while the external reserves stood at NPR 2 billion 90 million. The ratio of exports of goods and services to total GDP remains at about 7.0 percent and 34.7 percent respectively. Total imports of goods decreased by 21.4 percent with total imports valued at NPR 1 billion 57 million, while total exports of goods fell by 16.1 percent reaching NPR 16 billion 11 million. The total trade deficit decreased by 15.5 percent to NPR 14 billion 54 million. In terms of price indices, the import unit value index increased by 3.4 percent, while the export unit value index decreased by 5.3 percent in Jaistha 2080.  
In FY 2079/80, the contribution of internal and external sectors to the balance of payments shows that the total volume of remittances contributed approximately 22.8 percent of total GDP, with an estimated projection of about 23.0 percent in FY 2080/81. The total foreign direct investment stood at NPR 77 million. The total foreign exchange reserves reached NPR 15 billion 39 million as of Jaistha 2080, reflecting potential inflows of goods and services. The Nepalese Rupee depreciated against the US dollar by 2.8 percent, against the Euro by 12.9 percent, and against the Japanese Yen by 2.8 percent as of the end of Jaistha 2080.  
2.2.5 Informal and unreported economy  
The informal and unreported sectors of Nepal's economy are estimated to be significant. Formal employment and informal activities are widespread. Households produce goods and services for self-consumption, contributing to informal economic activity. According to the National Economic Census of 2075, among total economic establishments, 49.5 percent are operational without any formal registration, while 52 percent of formal establishments maintain registered transactions. Due to the lack of transparency, informal economic activities remain unintegrated within the tax base. By FY 2079/80, a total of 55,054 permanent tax identification numbers were issued for tax purposes. In the labor sector, informal labor and employment constitute a significant portion. According to the Nepal Labor Force Survey 2074/75, only 15.4 percent of the workforce was formally employed. The share of formal jobs in total employment is only 37.8 percent.  
In the informal sector, illegal production and transactions proliferate alongside activities like smuggling, trade diversion, and unrecorded wealth, reflecting the extent of informality in the economy.
