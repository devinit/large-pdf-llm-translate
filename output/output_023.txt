Chapter 12
State Reform and Good Governance Initiatives

12.1 Background
The constitution of Nepal aims to establish a welfare state by ensuring the rule of law, moral rights and human values, equal opportunity, proportional inclusion, federal democratic governance, citizen participation, and social justice, thereby creating a just governance system in all areas of national life. The essence of state reform and good governance has been the basis for establishing a welfare state. Over time, the scope and mandate of state reform have been expanding. If the overall expectations of the citizensâ€™ development and welfare are incorporated into the agenda of state reform, the objectives set by the constitution can be achieved effectively. It is also necessary to include the state reform process as a critical aspect from which the state can derive its indicative measures.

The essence of good governance needs to be characterized by transparency, legality, accountability, integrity, and effective action in political, administrative, and social realms. Strengthening the relationships between federal governments, provinces, and local levels to promote rights, accountability, and effective coordination is essential. The services provided by the state must ensure equal and easy access, while maintaining the dignity of citizens. 

12.2 Current Status
Since the promulgation of the constitution, two rounds of elections have been conducted through the electoral system at the federal, provincial, and local government levels. All levels of government have completed their initial terms and entered their subsequent phases, establishing a federal democratic republic. Public participation in politics has been increasing inclusively. Consequently, the establishment of democratic governance has led to the promotion of good governance. 

The initiatives for ensuring good governance require necessary legal and structural frameworks, citizen engagement, and group rights recognition. There is an expectation of improving the various dimensions and indicators of governance included in the 15th plan (FY 2081/82 - 2085/86), which is reflected in the enhancement related to governance indicators. However, comparisons reveal that the governance indicator targets outlined in the previous annual plan (FY 2080/81) have not been effectively met in FY 2079/80, showing a notable decline instead. The indicators regarding government effectiveness, corruption control, voice and accountability, regulatory quality, and political stability have demonstrated inadequate progress. 

Nepal's challenges concerning corruption have been linked to the systematic corruption in governance structures, which, accompanied by effective legal provisions, have been implemented through national strategies and action plans, including the 2069 (2012) initiatives. To combat the growing political corruption and bias against all ethnic minorities, it is necessary to create frameworks for action and implement international treaties, including policies regarding minority rights and citizen rights. 

To maintain a system of governance that promotes accountability, transparency, and effective service provision among the three tiers of government in Nepal, a comprehensive legal and institutional framework must be developed, supported by intergovernmental coordination and bridge communication.
