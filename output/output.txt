Prime Minister's Statement  
The Sixteenth Plan has been prepared in a timely manner to guide the economic, social, and environmental development of the country. With the establishment of a federal democratic republic, the focus of political leadership has now shifted towards economic development and prosperity. Since the establishment of the three-tiered government, activities for economic, social, and infrastructure development have been increasing. The professional skills and entrepreneurial spirit of businesses have been developing.  
In the context of 67 years of planning and development efforts, significant milestones have been achieved in the areas of economic, social, and infrastructure development through various efforts. However, despite these achievements, when compared to the existing needs of the country for development, the expectations of citizens, and the available resources and possibilities, our achievements appear overall to be insufficient. The goals that need to be achieved in accordance with the ongoing national development priorities cannot be successfully pursued if we continue with the traditional processes of planning and implementation. In this regard, it is necessary to create an environment for achieving the goals outlined in the current plan by providing new direction to the development practices we have been adopting so far.

The geographic location of the country, its unique natural features and society, the aspirations and demands of the citizens, the good relations initiated in international cooperation, and the need for coordinated development among various sectors of the state and society, all require strong support for good governance, prosperity, and justice, which remains a primary focus for effective implementation of the plan.  
Therefore, in order to make the plan ambitious and ensure effective implementation, it requires continuous collaboration among the state's various official entities.  
In the pursuit of inclusive development, this Sixteenth Plan is aimed at structural transformation that will usher in a new chapter in the country's overall development. To ensure that Nepal is a developing and prosperous country by 2026 and reaches the status of a middle-income country, the plan anticipates the realization of sustainable development goals by 2030, effective reduction of poverty and unemployment, and increasing access to services such as education, health, and social security for marginalized citizens.  
Ultimately, this Sixteenth Plan aims to bring about a positive change in the lives of ordinary citizens. Expressing gratitude to all who have been involved in the formulation of this plan, especially the National Planning Commission, I urge all stakeholders to actively participate in its implementation.  
Thank you.

Statement  
Nepal has been implementing planning for development for about half a century. During this period, ten five-year plans and five annual plans have been formulated and implemented. Based on a long-term vision for "Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepalis," the implementation of the Tenth Plan is expected to conclude by this economic year 2080/81, thus the Sixteenth Plan has been formulated to carry out implementation from the economic year 2081/82 to 2085/86. This plan envisions "good governance, social justice, and prosperity" and has established objectives and comprehensive strategies to promote equitable growth. The plan identifies the crucial issues and challenges that hinder our development and prosperity.

Among the various objectives of previous plans, progress has been satisfactory in social indicators, while the economic growth objectives and outcomes have shown significant disparities. Past plans faced long intervals for implementation; the Fourth Plan's social sector targets coupled with economic growth objectives reveal ongoing disparities. The Tenth Plan's implementation had challenges, including external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which adversely affected the achievement of its goals and targets. The experiences and learnings from previous plans have been integrated into the Sixteenth Plan.

This Sixteenth Plan has been designed to ensure its implementation is feasible, realistic, and result-oriented while guiding the overall direction of national development. The plan addresses the structural barriers affecting various dimensions and is aligned with transformational strategies and key programs incorporated within it. Additionally, the plan emphasizes the importance of strengthening the engagement of all relevant stakeholders in its implementation, and it aims to mainstream inclusivity across all dimensions of development, promote sustainable practices, and mitigate risks while enhancing evidence-based decision-making and implementation.

In creating this Sixteenth Plan, we acknowledge the invaluable guidance received from the honorable Prime Minister and the commission's chairperson. Similarly, we express our deeply felt gratitude to the government, political parties, development actors, civil society, non-governmental organizations, and development partners for their support and valuable suggestions provided during the plan's formulation. Furthermore, I would like to extend special thanks to members and staff of the National Planning Commission for their continued engagement in this plan's development.

**Introduction**
1.1 Background
Through a series of long-term planning efforts spanning over a decade, Nepal has achieved significant milestones in economic, social and infrastructural development. This journey has seen the evolution of the political system and governance framework, which have been integrated into the periodic planning process to enhance the strategic vision, objectives, priorities and implementation of development plans systematically.

Nepal’s vision aims to fulfill the aspirations of a federal democratic republic, which includes good governance, development and prosperity. It emphasizes the recognition of fundamental rights, enshrined in the constitution, and ensures economic justice and equality by designing a public management system that is proportional, inclusive and cooperative. The overarching economic goal of the state is to create an independent and progressive socialist economy with a robust, equitable and prosperous development framework. The long-term vision of 'Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali' has been established for developmental planning up to the year 2100.

Hence, through the institutional collaboration of public, private and cooperative sectors, the goal is to elevate Nepal to a developing country by 2026 (Fiscal Year 2083) while targeting sustainable development goals by 2030 (Fiscal Year 2087). The implementation of the recently initiated Fifth Plan (Fiscal Year 2076/77-2080/81) will conclude by the end of fiscal year 2081 and this Sixteenth Plan has been formulated to facilitate its implementation over the next five years (Fiscal Year 2081/82-2085/86).

1.2 Brief review of planning and development efforts
In the year 2013, the initiation of planning and development came to fruition with the establishment of the Planning Commission under the leadership of the Prime Minister, which issued the First Five-Year Plan (2013/14 - 2017/18) for implementation. From 2017 onwards, during the period of the Panchayat regime until 2046, the development of the second and other periodic plans were implemented. In 2046, following the restoration of multi-party democracy, an eight-tier federal system of governance was established and the implementation continued through the Eighth Plan (2049/50 - 2053/54) and Ninth Plan (2070/71 - 2072/73).

After the establishment of a federal democratic republic in 2072, the implementation of the Fourth Plan (2073/74 - 2075/76) began. Thereafter, new local and provincial governments were formed following elections, and the Fifth Plan (2076/77 - 2080/81) and individual provincial plans were implemented. Local authorities have also prepared their own periodic plans for implementation.

Three fiscal years: 2018/19, 2047/48 and 2048/49 were viewed as significant in terms of the implementation of periodic plans. The second and eleventh periodic plans and five more plans till the fourth have been implemented as five-year plans.

The Fifth Plan (2013/14-2017/18) focused on economic growth and social development with an aim to enhance output and employment, while ensuring effective utilization of resources for public welfare and the improvement of quality of life. This plan made substantial contributions to creating infrastructure such as agriculture, roads, and electricity crucial for economic services and development.

The Second Plan (2019/20-2021/22) aimed at formulating the foundation for long-term economic growth, employment creation and social justice, prioritizing infrastructure, agriculture and industrial development, and the service sector. It was considered a significant strategy for economic development.

The Third Plan (2022/23-2026/27) focused on establishing a just economy and promoting welfare through the enhancement of food production and trade, industrial development, and addressing economic disparities and inequalities. Agricultural development, effective resource management, and the strengthening of industry were key priorities outlined in this plan.

The Fourth Plan (2027/28-2031/32) identified the significance of increasing production, trade and communications, strengthening agriculture, and promoting international business. Issues such as value creation, economic regulation, and effective use of labor were prioritized. The plan also initiated sustainable economic development started with regional integration till then.

The Fifth Plan (2032/33-2036/37) emphasized production expansion, employment through effective use of labor, and balanced economic goals. It formulated appropriate structures for internal management, investment, and productivity while incorporating economic stability, industrial arrangements, and trade growth.

The Sixth Plan (2037/38-2041/42) emphasized rapid economic growth, the increase of productive employment, and the fulfillment of basic needs. It included strategies for the development of agriculture, small and medium enterprises, tourism, and the sustainable management of natural resources.

The Seventh Plan (2042/43-2046/47) aimed to continue the efforts from the Sixth Plan by focusing on increasing production and productivity and fulfilling basic community needs. It prioritized agriculture, forest resources, water resources, and the tourism sector for effective national economic integration.

The Eighth Plan (2049/50-2053/54) aligned with the restoration of multi-party democracy, burrowing strategies from the past, focusing on economic development and poverty eradication while addressing economic inequalities and facilitating agricultural productivity.

The Ninth Plan (2054/55-2058/59) targeted long-term sustainable development addressing poverty eradication, agricultural development, water resource management, and social equity.

The Tenth Plan (2059/60-2063/64) aimed for substantial financial growth through public-private partnerships and improvements in education, health, infrastructure and rural development initiatives.

The Eleventh Plan (2064/65-2066/67) focused on the economic transformation of Nepal, building infrastructure, enhancing social integration, and addressing socio-economic disparities through strategic collaboration among stakeholders for effective program implementation.

Introduction | 12th Plan (2067/68 - 2069/70) - The 12th plan aimed to create employment-focused, inclusive, and equitable economic growth, reduce poverty, establish a national education system, and enhance the overall experiences of the general public in their lives. This plan prioritized physical and social infrastructure development, job creation, economic growth, inclusion, good governance, and environmental sustainability. Under this framework, it set targets for thousand-year development goals, social indicators, employment generation, and revenue growth.

13th Plan (2070/71 - 2072/73) - The 13th plan aimed to elevate Nepal’s status from a Least Developed Country to a developing country, decrease poverty, and improve the overall quality of life of the general public. This plan emphasized hydropower and energy development, agricultural productivity growth, diversification and commercialization, good governance practices, natural resources, environmental conservation, tourism, and industrial development. New indicators on inclusion, equitable distribution, telecommunication and mobile phone density, road mileage, and forest coverage were significantly highlighted.

14th Plan (2073/74 - 75/76) - With the initiation of the federal governance system, the 14th plan was the first to cover and approach such a structure. This plan aimed to build a welfare state ensuring social justice while reaching the status of a developing country through independence, prosperity, and socialism. The objective was to reduce poverty significantly through productive job creation and a high growth rate of the economy generated through substantial economic transformations. While it aimed for an average of 7.2% economic growth, actual growth reached about 7.4%. The plan integrated internal production and employment generation with the overall developmental framework, addressing national statistics and monetary policy harmonization.

15th Plan (2076/77 - 2080/81) - The 15th plan is highlighted with a long-term perspective to sustain the economy and ensure progress, including achieving targets over five years. It drew from the high economic growth rate projected in the 14th plan amid challenges caused by political instability, prolonged load-shedding in electricity and frequent strikes, showcasing a targeted average growth of 9.6% but only achieving 2.6% due to adverse effects from COVID-19 pandemic shocks that significantly affected various sectors and halted supply chains, reducing overall employment generation and productive efforts.

The implication of the COVID-19 pandemic was undeniable in damaging sectors such as tourism, hospitality, and informal employment. With lockdown measures, various businesses were strained, leading to a sharp decline in economic activities and unprecedented decreases in overall economic output, including a contraction of around 2.4% in the economic growth for the fiscal year 2076/77. The sectors affected included food production, agriculture, industry, and construction.

The impact of COVID-19 on domestic and foreign tourism led to significant challenges for the economy. The lockdown also indicated systemic failures in the supply chain and commercial enterprises. Nonetheless, the pandemic opened an opportunity for digital transactions, spurred by a shift towards increased online financing and remittance flows which improved ease of electronic payments.

The initial phases of the crisis showed a drop in consumption which gradually rebuilt as external economic pressures resulted in a surge in economic activities. However, substantial trade imbalances led to a slumping foreign currency reserve, forcing the government to reassess its economic policies strategically.

Post-pandemic, the economic growth projections indicated moderate recovery; nonetheless, structural reforms remained necessary due to existing weaknesses identified in sectors, resulting in widespread challenges such as high trade deficits, inconsistent monetary policies, and a growing current account deficit. All these complexities provide the foundation for future strategic planning aimed at sustainable long-term growth, thus informing the basis of the 16th Plan that would integrate previously unresolved structural barriers within various sectors of the economy while addressing essential societal needs equitably.

In summary, the overarching goals for the 16th Plan (2081/82 - 2085/86) revolve around robust frameworks centered on good governance, social justice, and inclusive growth driven by strategic planning, with an ultimate goal of prosperity for all citizens reflecting on 2100 long-term visions and objectives set forth. 

**Long-term Vision 2100** 
Through a long-term development strategy promoting equitable systems and addressing root causes of economic disparity and needs, the government synthesizes strategies that conclude with clear objectives that ensure holistic social and economic empowerment in a harmonious, democratic Nepal.

Strengthening of comprehensive economic foundations and 
high economic growth 
2.1 Background  
Strengthening of comprehensive economic foundations can lead to high and sustainable economic growth. Economic growth can contribute positively to human well-being and standards of living. Similarly, qualitative changes in human life enhance economic indices. Understanding the state and direction of a country's economic development requires a focus on comprehensive economic indicators.  
In the context of Nepal's development, the participation of public, private, and cooperative sectors, along with a socialist framework, aims to establish a balanced and inclusive economy. Moreover, the role of the private sector in promoting growth is highlighted, facilitating achievements through competitive resource utilization and equitable development throughout the country. Nepal aims to transition from least developed to developing country status by the fiscal year 2083 (2026). Additionally, the target is to achieve substantial development goals by the fiscal year 2087 (2030) and become a middle-income country. In this context, the strengthening of comprehensive economic foundations, robust economic growth, and social equity remains a priority under the Sixteenth Plan. 
2.2 Current status  
2.2.1 Economic growth  
Over the last three decades, the country’s average economic growth rate has been around 4.3 percent. The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has further affected the growth of an already vulnerable economy in recent years. In FY 2080/81, the economic growth rate is estimated at 3.5 percent (in real terms) with GDP per capita at USD 1456. The contribution of agriculture and productivity has not been sufficiently robust, leading to stagnant economic growth overall. In FY 2080/81, the estimated contribution of agriculture to total GDP was 24.1 percent and non-agriculture was 75.9 percent. Similarly, the contribution of the primary sector was estimated at 24.6 percent, the secondary sector at 12.5 percent, and the tertiary sector at 62.9 percent. Total consumption has shown some decline along with total national savings, indicating a situation where aggregate capital formation remains somewhat subdued. In FY 2080/81, total savings as a ratio of GDP was 7.6 percent and total national savings was 36.2 percent. The share of total capital formation as a percentage of total GDP stands at 24.5 percent.  
2.2.2 Government revenue  
In the fiscal year 2079/80, Nepal government's total revenue collection goal fell short by 68.2 percent, while total GDP was 17.9 percent. Similarly, the total revenue expenditure remained at 79.7 percent. The capital expenditure was only 21.2 percent of the total budget, whereas recurrent expenditure occupied 61.4 percent. The contraction of revenue, coupled with expected underperformance in external aid, has led to a major destabilization in public finances.  
In FY 2079/80, the foreign direct investment growth rate was negative at 22 percent, reflecting the overall difficulties in mobilizing external resources. Out of the total financing mix, grants accounted for 11.8 percent and loans for 23.3 percent. The low revenue situation necessitated increasing reliance on internal (domestic) borrowing. In FY 2079/80, 4.8 percent of total GDP was funded through internal borrowing, indicating that by the end of that year, the outstanding debts accounted for 43.0 percent of total GDP, with internal lending at 21.1 percent and external borrowing at 21.9 percent.  
With the adoption of a federal governance structure, three tiers of government have coordinated and collaborated in the public budget management and implementation. Local and provincial governments have significant roles in operationalizing public funds. The Nepal government has been allocating approximately 24 percent of the total fiscal budget to provincial and local governments. Additionally, revenue sharing and single-tier tax collection have facilitated local and provincial revenue collection under the federal budget framework. The need for effective internal resource mobilization and efficient revenue management in the coming days is underscored. 
Strengthening of comprehensive economic foundations and high economic growth | 25 2.2.3 Monetary and financial sectors and capital market  
During the initial years of the Fifteenth Plan, consumer price inflation was relatively low, but following the COVID-19 pandemic and other internal and external disturbances, the period saw some increase in prices. In FY 2079/80, the average national consumer price inflation was recorded at 7.7 percent. Money supply growth was at 11.4 percent and gross foreign reserves increased by 26.1 percent. In that year, total domestic credit rose by 8.7 percent, and the deposits of banks and financial institutions increased by 12.3 percent. The credit growth in the private sector rose by 3.8 percent. In Jaistha 2080, the average interbank lending rate was recorded at 6.4 percent. The average operating inter-bank rate was 3.1 percent as of Jaistha 2080.  
The lending rates of commercial banks averaged at 10.0 percent, while the weighted average lending rates from rural and cooperative banks were recorded at 7.9 percent and for microfinance institutions at 12.3 percent. As of the end of Jaistha 2080, the total number of banks and financial institutions reached 11,589. Accordingly, there is a ratio of one bank and financial institution to the total population of 25,173. The contribution of the financial sector, including non-banking financial institutions, continues to grow. Institutions such as savings and cooperatives, citizen investments, and consumer financing play crucial roles in expanding financial access, promoting investable capital, and maintaining financial stability.  
Insurance companies, as of the end of FY 2079/80, recorded a growth of 7.9 percent in life insurance and a 0.2 percent growth in non-life insurance. During this duration, the population covered by insurance reached 44.4 percent. In the capital market, the NEPSE index stood at 2097.1 as of Jaistha 2080. The number of listed companies on the Nepal Stock Exchange stood at 254, with a market capitalization of NPR 308.2 billion.  
2.2.4 External sector  
The trade deficit continues to persist in recent years. External reserves remain under pressure, contributing to the current account deficit. In FY 2079/80, the current account recorded a deficit of NPR 72.16 billion, while the external reserves stood at NPR 2 billion 90 million. The ratio of exports of goods and services to total GDP remains at about 7.0 percent and 34.7 percent respectively. Total imports of goods decreased by 21.4 percent with total imports valued at NPR 1 billion 57 million, while total exports of goods fell by 16.1 percent reaching NPR 16 billion 11 million. The total trade deficit decreased by 15.5 percent to NPR 14 billion 54 million. In terms of price indices, the import unit value index increased by 3.4 percent, while the export unit value index decreased by 5.3 percent in Jaistha 2080.  
In FY 2079/80, the contribution of internal and external sectors to the balance of payments shows that the total volume of remittances contributed approximately 22.8 percent of total GDP, with an estimated projection of about 23.0 percent in FY 2080/81. The total foreign direct investment stood at NPR 77 million. The total foreign exchange reserves reached NPR 15 billion 39 million as of Jaistha 2080, reflecting potential inflows of goods and services. The Nepalese Rupee depreciated against the US dollar by 2.8 percent, against the Euro by 12.9 percent, and against the Japanese Yen by 2.8 percent as of the end of Jaistha 2080.  
2.2.5 Informal and unreported economy  
The informal and unreported sectors of Nepal's economy are estimated to be significant. Formal employment and informal activities are widespread. Households produce goods and services for self-consumption, contributing to informal economic activity. According to the National Economic Census of 2075, among total economic establishments, 49.5 percent are operational without any formal registration, while 52 percent of formal establishments maintain registered transactions. Due to the lack of transparency, informal economic activities remain unintegrated within the tax base. By FY 2079/80, a total of 55,054 permanent tax identification numbers were issued for tax purposes. In the labor sector, informal labor and employment constitute a significant portion. According to the Nepal Labor Force Survey 2074/75, only 15.4 percent of the workforce was formally employed. The share of formal jobs in total employment is only 37.8 percent.  
In the informal sector, illegal production and transactions proliferate alongside activities like smuggling, trade diversion, and unrecorded wealth, reflecting the extent of informality in the economy.  

Strengthening of the Integrated Economic System and High Economic Growth | 27 2.2.6 Private and Non-Governmental Sectors  
With the countries adopting market-oriented economic policies, the role of private and non-governmental sectors has been gaining importance. In recent times, significant growth can be observed in the cooperation of the private sector with production, supply, construction, service, employment generation, and foreign trade activities. The units of the private sector have been playing a leading role in total savings and national consumption and investment, whereas the cooperative and non-governmental sectors contribute to the production of goods and services. In the fiscal year 2079/80, the private sector accounted for 91.3 percent of total private consumption, while the contribution of non-governmental institutions was 2.0 percent. The private sector's share in total capital construction stood at 65.7 percent. Through partnership and collaboration with the government, the private and non-governmental sectors are supporting economic growth. Currently, 51,513 non-governmental institutions are operational at the national and international levels.  
2.2.7 Cooperative Sector  
Alongside the state and private sectors, the cooperative sector has been actively integrating into the country's economy. By the end of the fiscal year 2079/80, there were about 31,500 cooperative institutions operating. The number of active members in cooperative institutions surpassed 73 lakh. Cooperatives make up 56 percent of the total membership. The number of savings and loan cooperatives is relatively high among all cooperatives. These institutions have mobilized a total share capital of Rs. 94 billion, collecting Rs. 4 billion 78 million in savings and Rs. 4 billion 26 million in loan flow. More than 93 thousand citizens have received employment through cooperative associations.  
2.2.8 Public Enterprises  
As of the fiscal year 2079/80, 62 public enterprises had been established and operational, with a total of 44 remaining functional. After liberalization, 30 enterprises were privatized, while some were newly established and others merged. Among the 44 public enterprises, 26 operate at a profit while 15 are running at a loss. Likewise, three enterprises have zero transactions. By the end of the fiscal year 2079/80, a total of Rs. 6 billion 61 million had been invested by the Government of Nepal in these enterprises.

2.6 Quantitative Targets  
2.6.1 National Economic Targets  
Overall economic growth and GDP: The issuance of respective federal practices has witnessed advancement in the national stability framework. There exists ample opportunity arising from the government's effort in correlation with private sector collaboration. In this regard, the Sixteenth Plan will forge notable improvement in developmental management and project governance, with anticipation that national pride projects and comprehensive sectoral initiatives will be completed, positively impacting growth metrics.

Overall, sectors focusing on agriculture, forestry, fisheries, water, manufacturing, energy, tourism, transport, communication, and health are projected to enhance overall productivity. It is estimated that the national economic target will observably grow at a rate that shall meet a calculated GDP growth of around 7.1% (base-year value) for the plan period. It’s envisaged that specific sectors will grow at the rates of 4.1% for agriculture, 11.3% for industries, and 7.2% for services.

Through appropriate measures addressing recent national and international circumstances, aligned governmental actions will yield positive impacts on growth projections, leading to the achievement of overall fiscal objectives more feasible. Hence, specific targets shall see estimated growth rates specified for the years 2081/82 to 2085/86 accounting for annual changes.

Subsequently, the GDP is anticipated to reach exceptionally 80 billion 19 billion 76 crore (base year 2079/80 value). From this projection, primary sector value addition will reach around 15 billion 16 billion 73 crore; secondary sector is expected to stand at 10 billion 81 billion 96 crore while tertiary sector may amount to around 45 billion 3 billion 9 crore. The total value addition is expected at 71 billion 1 billion 78 crore. Inflation targets are set to maintain between 5 - 6 percent for fiscal viability, estimating the flow of GDP to touch 103 billion 7 billion 32 crore as estimated in nominal values towards the later plan years, with targeted values for various sectors detailed further herein.

The projected significant structural transformation in industry and service sector is expected to continue under the directive of the plan. The contribution of the primary sector to the total GDP is estimated to decline from 24.6 percent to 21.4 percent. The contribution of the secondary sector is projected to grow from 12.5 percent to 15.2 percent. It is anticipated that the contribution of the service sector will increase from 62.9 percent to 63.4 percent. This shows that the share of the secondary sector may increase at the expense of the primary sector, while substantial labor from the agriculture sector moves towards the industry and services sectors.

(c) Marginal Capital Output Ratio and Investment: The planned fiscal year will significantly maintain economic growth through investments from the public, private and cooperative sectors as a result of the economic growth focused on rational structural transformation. It is projected that there will be considerable capital formation and an increase in employment opportunities. In this year, the productivity activities will be implemented within the targeted environment that is a distinction from previous activities. The preliminary proposals regarding capital formation and investment will also see transformations under the plan. Existing initiatives concerning investment in this plan will be completed and operationalized. Significant growth can be attributed from the public sector projects run collaboratively between the federal, provincial and local governments under different initiatives.

58 | Sixteenth Plan (fiscal year 2081/82 - 2085/86) (g) Long-term source management of investment: The plan has estimated a total investment of Rs. 94 billion 82 crore (at the price of fiscal year 2080/81). The required funding will come from government and cooperative financial institutions and non-government sources. Since investment from traditional sources is insufficient, new alternative sources have been identified, which will be managed accordingly. Traditional sources will include government revenue, foreign aid, cooperative loans, and share capital from non-government sources, while alternative sources will involve foreign investment, public-private partnerships, official investments, project development loans, income flows from natural resource endowments, green industry management, climate financing, carbon taxes, and various public financial institutions.  
(h) Consumption, savings, and capital formation: Since total savings and national consumption determine the capital formation ratio, the sixteenth plan aims to significantly increase total capital formation while encouraging savings by cutting unnecessary consumption. The plan estimates a ratio of savings to total output at 91.5% and 8.2% respectively. Total national savings is targeted to reach 39.0% of total output. Similarly, total capital formation is estimated to be maintained at 28.6% of total output. The share of government investment in total capital formation is expected to be 30.2% and that of non-government sources (including cooperatives) will be 69.8%.

2.6.2 Government Revenue  
According to the plan's framework, good governance, social equity, and sustainable growth are crucial for public finance management. This framework focuses on managing internal revenue to create jobs and overall productivity improvements, enabling the government to maintain discipline and efficiency in public finance management. The plan estimates that Rs. 120 billion 63 crore will be generated from government sources. Out of this, Rs. 45 billion 71 crore will be current revenue, Rs. 27 billion 71 crore will come from capital revenue, Rs. 22 billion 57 crore will be revenue from capital arrangements, and Rs. 24 billion 62 crore will be derived from capital transfers (grants). It is estimated that the key source of government revenue will be the federal revenue, contributing Rs. 84 billion 65 crore. Total divisible revenue is projected to be around Rs. 95 billion 30 crore.   
The plan predicts Rs. 17 billion 52 crore from foreign aid. The total estimated revenue and foreign aid expected to be generated from the plan is around Rs. 18 billion 42 crore, which will be utilized for internal loans. The contributions of public finance are explained in detail in Table 2.8.

2.6.5 Informal and Alternative Economy  
Given the significant role of the informal economy in the country’s economy, issues related to resource management and liquidity will be addressed in the plan to formalize the economy. The liquidity management strategies will focus on eliminating illegal trade, smuggling, and unauthorized transactions, enhancing effective regulation of the informal economy. It is estimated that around 85% of institutions will be operating legally and about 88% of them will be keeping transaction records. As the economy becomes more formal, it is expected that the number of newly registered taxpayers will reach around 80,000.

**Production, productivity, and competitive environment overview**

3.1 Background

To make the national economy independent, strong, and self-reliant, it is necessary to identify the sources of production available in the country and enhance production and productivity through effective utilization of these resources. It is vital to make all sectors of the economy dynamic and competitive, ensuring quality goods production and effective service delivery to improve the living standards of the general population. The production and productivity of agriculture, industry, energy, forests, tourism, education, and health sectors are critical for the economic development and prosperity of the country, which requires the efficient operation of capital, infrastructure, labor, and land resources.

Achieving productivity in the primary sector is essential through effective protection and other uses of agricultural land, improving the productivity of agriculture and livestock, and systematically managing industrial development and income generation to ensure a self-reliant economy. The service sector should develop as a quality, business-oriented, competitive, sustainable solution to make the economy dynamic. The products produced in the primary sector should be used as inputs in the secondary sector, with the primary and secondary sectors utilizing the outputs of the tertiary sector. Overall, the interdependence of the economic development sectors plays a crucial role in enhancing production, productivity, and competitiveness.

3.2 Current Situation

Nepal's national agricultural policy has traditionally focused on the use of sustainable land resources and the elimination of dual exploitation regarding long-term agricultural development. By 2100, the commercialization of the agricultural sector, along with the use of clean, renewable, and high-quality resources for industries and services, is expected to significantly contribute to production and productivity. In the 14th plan period, it has been estimated that the average contribution of the primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors to the economy will reach 24.1, 17.6, and 58.3 percent respectively. As of the fiscal year 2079/80, these contributions stand at 24.6, 13.0, and 62.4 percent respectively. 

The efforts made in the agricultural sector have resulted in a significant increase in the productivity of major agricultural crops, reaching an average of 3.42 metric tons per hectare by 2079/80. Among irrigable lands, around 25 percent has achieved full irrigation infrastructure. Currently, the trend of commercializing agriculture is increasing, with a focus on high-value crops, cash crops, and agricultural tourism. Despite the target yields not being met for key crops like paddy, wheat, millet, and maize, production continues to rise for fish, meat, eggs, and milk, indicating a movement towards self-reliance in the country's agricultural sectors. Essential commodities (agricultural products, livestock, and food items) accounted for a target contribution of 5 percent in the total income in the 14th plan, but this figure has reached 15 percent.

Within total agricultural production, the target contribution of the industrial sector was projected to be 6.5 percent in the 14th plan, whereas it reached 5.3 percent in the fiscal year 2079/80. For the growth of industrial development, necessary supply chain frameworks, the establishment and operation of industrial zones, and appropriate laws and regulations have been set up. The contribution of the tourism sector to total agricultural production is estimated at 2.0 percent, with around 2 million participants employed in this sector. This sector generated a foreign exchange income of $548.1 million in 2023. By the fiscal year 2079/80, the total contribution of hydropower and alternative energy sources to the national electrical system reached 2877 megawatts, while the distribution electricity stood at 380 megawatt-hours. A total of 15 million ha have been set aside to provide irrigation facilities.

Productive Employment, Migrant Labor, and Social Protection
4.1 Background
The Constitution of Nepal has guaranteed the rights of social protection and labor and employment in accordance with dignified living. The productivity of labor ensures that productive employment, decent work, and social protection are maintained through effective management and productivity enhancement, aiming to reduce risks to human life, rapid economic growth, and inclusive development of social justice by contributing towards national goals. The development strategy aims to generate secure jobs and promote sustainable livelihoods, providing equal pay for equal work, social security, establishing decent work relationships, respecting labor and workers, ending all forms of labor exploitation, ensuring labor rights, and implementing occupational health and safety measures. It is essential to utilize the demographic dividends available in the country by aligning with the needs of the labor market to create innovative, skilled, mobile, competitive, and service-oriented manpower, which contributes to national production and productivity enhancement.

88 | Sixteenth Plan (Fiscal Year 2081/82 - 2085/86) 4.2 Current Situation
The current situation regarding the development strategy involves facilitating productive employment, establishing harmonious relations between workers and entrepreneurs, expanding the scope of social security, and utilizing the skills, capital, and experience gained from migrant employment domestically. The Constitution has enshrined the rights to employment, social protection, and labor as fundamental human rights. The International Labor Organization’s conventions have emphasized decent and secure employment, universal social protection, and productivity of labor rights. Legislative measures for managing both domestic and international labor include the Bonus Act-2076, Trade Union Act-2049, Foreign Employment Act-2064, Employment Rights Act-2075, Social Security Act-2074, Labor Act-2074, National Employment Policy-2071, and Foreign Employment Policy-2068 have been implemented. Timely amendments to these laws and policies have provided new directions. Additionally, measures have been taken to enhance the management of domestic job creation by eliminating forced migration for foreign employment and attracting domestic job opportunities.

According to the National Census 2078, the population structure of Nepal reflects that the productive age (15-59 years) group accounts for 67 percent. This demographic dividend is expected to remain until 2103. In the past decade, there has been a significant shift towards international labor migration from the domestic labor market, which has been marked by falling demand for domestic workers, an imbalance in labor demand and supply, and a decline in respect for labor culture. The unemployment rate stands at 11.4 percent, with 36.5 percent of the labor force engaged in formal employment. The participation rate of the working-age population is at 38.5 percent. Recent statistics indicate that informal labor sectors are six times larger than those involved in formal employment. The dropout rate from education has also seen a significant increase, although notable efforts have been initiated to regulate informal employment, domestic work, and unregulated labor. The prevalence of child labor has generally been decreasing, yet about 11 lakh children aged 5-13 are still involved in domestic labor.

89 | Productive Employment, Migrant Labor, and Social Protection. The government has launched a national master plan for the eradication of child labor, aiming to declare local areas free of child labor by implementing the national action plan for the years 2075-2085. As of the Fiscal Year 2079/80, a total of 14 local areas have been declared free of child labor. Ensuring the sustainability of social security systems, the number of formal workers identified for contributions is increasing. By the end of the fiscal year 2080, according to the National Economic Census 2075, of the 9 lakh 23 thousand 356 establishments registered in Nepal, 18,847 establishments and 12,80,888 workers were covered under the social security scheme.

The establishment of the unified national social security system in 2080 aims to enhance the coverage of social protection, ensuring that contributions are made while addressing the gradual increase in livelihood benefits. Labor force surveys indicate that about 15 percent of workers are included in the social security system. The target in the 15th Plan aims to achieve 60 percent coverage in the social security scheme, while it is estimated that 32 percent of this has been reached. Approximately 14.8 percent of the federal budget for social security has been allocated to 87 programs. Social security programs are being implemented by provincial governments and local authorities. This year, with an increasing focus on disaster management, collective efforts will be made to enhance the coverage of contributions to social protection. The establishment of a unified national social security structure will be a significant step forward.

There is a lack of integrated data on employment opportunities available in the labor market. The inability to match the labor supplied with the job opportunities available in the domestic labor market has prompted workers to seek employment abroad. In the fiscal year 2079/80, 771,327 Nepalese entered the foreign labor market as newly employed and re-employed workers. It is estimated that 57 percent of households rely on remittance income, amounting to approximately 12 billion Rupees. This amount accounts for about 23 percent of the total gross domestic product. The number of workers seeking foreign employment is steadily rising, resulting in an increase in social service demands.

**Chapter 5**  
Building a healthy, skilled, and capable human capital  

**5.1 Background**  
Human capital significantly contributes to economic transformation and development. It derives from collective knowledge, skills, and abilities alongside health personnel. Investment in health, education, and sports promotes economic growth and social welfare. Nepal's constitution mandates guaranteeing health, education, and overall human life, leading to a basic structure in human capital development.  

Health impacts productivity and labor capacity throughout a person’s life. Human capital development today not only addresses future necessities but also encourages current needs. Healthy parents provide a nurturing and healthy environment for their children. Health levels in the population contribute significantly to long-term economic harmony and transformation. In this context, ensuring accessible and quality health services is essential.  

Early childhood development initiatives ensure accessible, inclusive, quality, timely, and life-sustaining education. A skilled and competent workforce contributes to national growth. Education leads to economic prosperity, social progress, and knowledge creation and is vital for preparing a youthful workforce for national development.  

Physical fitness and organization lead to productive workers, the building of social and cultural capital, national and international identity, and play an important role for economic growth. Developing a system that incorporates skilled human resources, supporting economic viability, and growth is crucial.  

**5.2 Current Situation**  
At the end of the fiscal year 2079/80, health indicators such as mothers receiving antenatal care in accordance with protocols showed at least four visits, reaching about 80%, child vaccination rates reached 80%, and maternal mortality rate reached 151 deaths per 100,000 live births. The neonatal mortality rate and under-five mortality rate reached 21 and 33 per 1,000 live births, respectively. Child mortality and vaccination coverage for children under five have not been fully achieved. The increasing age of citizens has been accompanied by rising health issues, both temporary and chronic. Essential responses are needed to address health sector concerns using regulatory measures.  

In terms of higher education, there is gender parity concerning qualifications. According to the 2021 Census, the literacy rate among females aged 15 and above is 76.3%, while it is 92% for males in the age group 15-24. Gandaki, Bagmati, and Koshi provinces have been declared fully literate areas. Universities provide multiple learning pathways, but the literacy rate in primary education is around 94.9%, basic health literacy stands at 96.1%, and secondary (grades 9-12) literacy is at 57.4%. While these literacy rates are impressive, the dropout rates across educational levels remain concerning.  

Investment in higher education remains limited, thereby affecting necessary human resource output for the country's needs. The budgeting for research and educational projects continues to decline, impacting effective research development.

Quality Physical Infrastructure Development and Integrated Internal-Resilience | 127
Quality Physical Infrastructure Development and Integrated Internal-Resilience 
6.1 Overview
The internal resilience between quality physical infrastructure and its development is crucial in the overall development of the country. Transport, energy, irrigation, sanitation, and information infrastructure provide the basis for economic development. The structure of all infrastructures should be sustainable, quality-oriented, environmentally friendly, climate-sensitive, promote green energy, and be inclusive, which can enhance production and productivity, thereby increasing national income. Sustainable development and climate adaptation are important aspects that highlight the role of green energy in internal resilience systems and renewable energy promotion. Therefore, the use of integrated infrastructure investments and sustainable practices is essential in environmental management, river management structures, irrigation, and energy infrastructure by utilizing high-end information technologies.

To promote rural livelihoods through market access and support economic activities related to industries, tourism, agriculture, and energy sectors, a unified internal resilience management system, along with communication and information infrastructure, plays a significant role. The government's focus is on harmonizing physical infrastructures, energy, irrigation, drinking water, forestry environment, climate resilience, communications, and information systems for effective development. The first three-year plan (2013-2018) prioritized investment in physical infrastructures (transportation, agriculture, energy, and irrigation). While development efforts focused on physical infrastructure access and usage, the need arises now to address environmental sustainability as well as adaptability to climate change in project designs. Moreover, leveraging information infrastructure to strengthen national and international connectivity is a priority for this plan.

6.2 Current Status 
(1) Transportation Infrastructure: The legal and planning frameworks related to transportation infrastructure are underway. Strategic road networks, including national highways and the construction of railway projects, such as the Mid-Hill Highway, Madan Bhandari Highway, Hulaki Highway, north-south trade routes, industrial corridors, and the Kathmandu-Rasuwagadi fast-track are currently operational. The federal government has constructed 18,052 km of blacktop roads, 7,696 km of gravel roads, and 8,491 km of earthen roads, totaling 34,239 km of road construction completed by the fiscal year 2079/80. Provinces and local levels have contributed to the construction of 66,000 km of roads. The Mid-Hill Highway has completed 1,879 km of its total and 72.7% of construction, while the Hulaki Highway has completed approximately 90% of its 1,857 km. Construction work remains unfinished on 38 km out of 50 km of the Sarankot-Sallisal road connecting Humla's district headquarters.

(2) Bridges and Tunnels: Among national pride projects related to essential infrastructures, 942 bridges are planned, of which 534 have been completed to date. Given Nepal's unique geographical context, it is emphasized to prioritize the construction of safe and reliable transport networks. Currently, the breakthrough has been achieved on the Ratna Highway, and projects are initiated for the Sipababa Tunnel and the Chhahare Tunnel. Under the operation of alternative structural management, footbridges have also been constructed.

(3) Railways and Water Transport: For the East-West railway, as of the fiscal year 2079/80, 59 km of track has been completed for the Bardibas-Chandragadhi railway, along with nine rail bridges. Out of the 69 km from Jaynagar to Janakpur, railway services are operational from Jaynagar to Janakpur and Sitauli. Track construction is ongoing for the Bhadrapur-Sitamari line. In relation to water transport, feasibility studies have been completed for operating vessels on rivers like the Gandaki, Koshi, Narayani, and for passenger terminals on the Koshi and Narayani rivers.

(4) Air Transport: Out of 54 national airports, 35 are operational. Though Bhairahawa and Pokhara International Airport have come into operation, commercial flights have not yet started. Environmental reassessment for the construction of Nijgadh International Airport is ongoing.

(5) Road Transport Management: It is necessary to enhance traffic management for safer, quality, and efficient transport. Renowned number plates should be installed through a systematic method. The provision that was initiated for the provision of vehicles produced or registered in Nepal is being monitored under the Traffic Management Act, 2003. Electronic payment systems have been introduced for smooth and efficient vehicle management services.

(6) Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation Infrastructure: The improvement of energy transmission and road infrastructure is a priority. To date, 3,200 MW has been incorporated into the national electricity grid from hydroelectric and alternative energy sources. Currently, 84 MW of alternative energy sources have not yet been included into the national system. Overall, about 98% of the population has access to electricity, with 96.7% from the national grid and 1.3% from alternative energy sources. The share of renewable energy in total energy is 7.4%. As of FY 2079/80, the total length of transmission lines of 66 kV and above has reached 5,742 circuit kilometers. The total capacity of substations is 8,867 MVA (Mega Volt Ampere). 

As of FY 2079/80, one thousand four hundred seventy-eight megawatts of electricity has been produced by approximately nine billion rupees’ worth of international currency.

**Urban Planning, Development and Emerging Urbanization and Settlement Development**  
**Chapter 7**  

**7.1 Background**  
Urban planning, development, and emerging urbanization and settlement development help enhance the quality of urban life, production facilities, and productivity in development sectors. Therefore, effective and coordinated implementation of urban planning has been primarily emphasized in the national development strategy. Geographical, regional, and rural perspectives help improve production and productivity, fostering sustainable urbanization. In this context, the past plans concerning urban renewal and urban development initiatives provide us with insights, while the shifts in the developmental approach in urbanization have been systematically incorporated into Nepal's urban policy, strategy, and plans (such as sustainable urban development risk mitigation strategies, inclusive development goals, and the New Urban Agenda).

Due to the allure of services, infrastructure, and opportunities, Nepal is rapidly urbanizing. However, the accessibility of infrastructure and services in the urban areas of high mountains and hilly regions is being compromised due to a declining population in these areas. Urbanization has become unbalanced and multifaceted. As a result of the multi-faceted urban dynamics, it has been recognized that urban planning approaches have not adequately addressed the challenges of urban areas. Coordination and collaborative partnerships are crucial for effectively managing and planning urban systems, which require a holistic approach to strengthening urban systems promoting productivity and development. Experiences obtained from the implementation of federal governance, along with the need for planning for urban and rural integration, bring forth a necessity for coordinated management.

**7.2 Current Situation**  
According to the National Census 2078, the population residing in municipalities is 66.02 percent, while urban population classification reports indicate that urban population constitutes 27.07 percent in Nepal. Approximately 40 percent of the population is living in suburban areas, demonstrating an increased aspiration for urbanization. Despite the expectation of urbanization, the significant gap in urban services and facilities still prevails. 

Overall, there is a huge disparity in infrastructure and amenities within municipalities. According to the National Urban Strategy, 2073, there exists a significant gap in urban infrastructure indicators (e.g., Kathmandu Metropolitan City at 0.91 and Gulariya Municipality at 0.16). The average urban road density in the old 58 municipalities stands at 3.26 km per sq km, while the average road density in all municipalities is considerably lower than that. The urban areas such as Kathmandu and Lalitpur show a significant lack of essential public infrastructure.

Urban planners and developers need to consider the growing pressures on urban systems and the varying availability of urban infrastructure. There is still considerable difficulty in accessing services, working production facilities, and better living conditions in urban areas. 

Future urban development efforts must focus not only on physical infrastructure but also on integrating socio-cultural aspects, sustainable management, and fostering community engagement to achieve effective urban governance and planning coherence is vital.

**7.3 Major Issues and Challenges**  
- **Inequality in Urbanization:** The urban system should be integrated through process-oriented approaches addressing rural-urban integration and sustainable governance. There is a dire need for establishing prominent urban centers in regions to improve the urban economic systems.
  
- **Coordination and Urban Governance:** Enhancing the engagement of national, provincial, and local stakeholders is essential to strengthen urban service delivery while effectively managing urban coordination systems and governance structures.
  
- **Investment Management and Planning:** There is still a need for innovative financing options for urban development projects, enabling partnerships with the private sector, joint ventures and leveraging varied investment mechanisms.
  
- **Environmental Considerations:** Addressing environmental challenges in urban areas is critical for sustainable development, hence implementing effective infrastructural and regulatory measures must be prioritized to mitigate adverse climatic impacts.

**7.4 Transformational Strategies**  
The purpose of these strategies is to strengthen urban systems at national and provincial levels through consistent policy measures and governance structures that can efficiently allocate resources, improve service accessibility, and facilitate inclusively designed urban spaces accommodating diverse populations and their needs.

Overall, these strategies demand a concerted effort from government agencies, stakeholders, and communities to ensure that urbanization in Nepal does not just flourish but does so in an equitable, efficient and sustainable manner, using innovative practices to bridge gaps in existing systems.

**Strengthening Regional and Local Economies and Sustainable Economic Development**  

9.1 Background  
The country's transition from a unitary governance system to a federal system has significantly altered the structure and form of the national economy. Economic activities conducted by the federal government contribute to the empowerment of provincial and local economies, which in turn supports the national economy in being robust and resilient. The federal system commits to principles of economic equality, inclusiveness, and social justice while strengthening the sustainable economic development of provincial and local economies. By enhancing the effectiveness of the federal governance system, coordination and synergies among national, provincial, and local economies must be strengthened to further consolidate their integration with the national economy. By strengthening regional and local economies, the fulfillment of fundamental rights, inclusive economic development that reduces inequality, effective implementation of poverty alleviation strategies, environmental sustainability, climate adaptation, and sustainable development, human capital development, and local community participation must be addressed. 

The practice of the federal governance system has led to the identification of local resources, effective management, and the creation of opportunities based on innovative resources. Additionally, cooperation, collaboration, coordination, and mutual support among the federal, provincial, and local governments enhance the potential for economic activities and the mobilization of local economies toward contributing to a prosperous national economy. The legal framework governing economic activities and revenue management has been structured to provide clear rights regarding taxation and revenue distribution, ensuring the economic empowerment of provincial and local economies. The goal is to utilize internal revenues effectively to support the national economy, and strategies based on established standards and indicators are being adopted to guide intergovernmental fiscal transfers.

In line with the spirit of federalism, significant enhancements have been made to the rights and responsibilities of provincial and local governments, along with mutual legal frameworks facilitating shared economic rights, resulting in enhanced economic development, equitable growth, and cohesion among the various levels of government. 

9.2 Current Situation  
The ongoing efforts for economic sustainability and equity in the context of resource and wealth distribution have been largely based on the adoption of the federal governance system; however, the objectives of enhancing the provincial and local economies have faced challenges. Despite the significant investments made by local governments, particularly in various sectors such as health, education, sanitation, and infrastructures, there continue to be socio-economic disparities among different provinces and localities. The focus is now shifting towards identifying and addressing the drivers of economic growth while ensuring that provincial and local governments engage in cooperative planning and management.

In the economic year 2079/80, the total agricultural production across the country was NRs 5.381 billion, with the Bagmati Province accounting for 36.9% of it.

Article 10
Poverty Alleviation and Inequality Reduction and Building an Inclusive Society 
10.1 Background
The government of Nepal has envisioned an inclusive society through the abolition of all forms of discrimination based on class, caste, ethnicity, religion, gender, and all kinds of gender segregation; affording economic equality, prosperity, and social justice as the foundational basis for collective participation and social growth. Essential services like education, housing, employment and social security have been established as fundamental rights. With the adoption of a federal governance structure, the aim is to eliminate all forms of discrimination and oppression within society and ensure economic equality, prosperity, and social justice. Furthermore, the long-term vision aims to eradicate poverty by 2100 and targets to diversify poverty reduction strategies in a holistic way. 
In conjunction with development planning, strategies for reducing poverty and inequality have been integrated. Various national and global efforts towards poverty alleviation have focused on effective participation and collaboration. Despite significant efforts, gaps in achieving the target poverty alleviation goals have highlighted the continued urgency to effectively respond to all forms of inequalities present in society. Transformational efforts are necessary to create a truly inclusive society by ensuring equal access to economic, social, and institutional opportunities.

10.2 Current Status
The government-led initiatives have shown progress in terms of poverty alleviation and inequality reduction. According to the Fourth Living Standards Survey, 2022, 20.3 percent of the total population of Nepal is living in poverty, with the urban poverty rate at 18.3 percent and rural poverty at 24.7 percent. Among the provinces, Karnali and Sudurpaschim have been recognized as having a higher poverty rate compared to the national average. Significant disparities exist in economic, social, geographic, gender, and caste metrics. Provinces like Bagmati and Gandaki hold relatively lower poverty levels compared to others. Multidimensional poverty indicators also reflect a concerning state, with Karnali province exhibiting a poverty rate of 39.5 percent while Bagmati stands at a mere 7 percent. 

The ratio of vulnerable communities represented in government machinery remains inadequate against the targeted sustainable development efforts. Additionally, the Gender Inequality Index demonstrates persistent inequality across all regions. Despite initiatives undertaken, local community representation in governance mechanisms needs further enhancement to achieve inclusive growth. 

10.3 Key Issues and Challenges
(1) Mapping and targeting poverty: There is a need to identify vulnerable households and establish targeted interventions addressing geographical disparities to effectively tackle poverty.

Effective Public Financial Management and Capital Expenditure | 2075 Nepal's fiscal revenue management and its share in national government expenditure according to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) analysis between the economic years 2048/49 and 2075/76 shows that public capital expenditure has significantly decreased in 2079/80. The government's share of total capital expenditure continues to fluctuate with the consistent percentage of current and capital expenditure remaining at 11 percent in economic year 2048/49, which has significantly decreased to 4.4 percent in economic year 2079/80. It has become evident that the share of foreign grants in domestic capital investment is declining for effective public financial management while the share of internal debt is increasing. 

Structural issues remain in revenue collection. The contribution of indirect taxes to total revenue is considerably lower. With the current expenditure share in the overall budget increasing, capital expenditure planning and allocation have become increasingly critical. The share of capital expenditure is predominantly influenced by economic conditions and has become weaker in quality. The total structure of capital expenditure planning is constantly growing in size. Ineffective utilization of grant funding has led to the situation where the internal debt is being managed through public financial management.

Key Issues and Challenges

(4) Project Management: Prioritizing project implementation, re-evaluation of project prioritization, and effective operational management of project banks; applying systematic and effective land and forest management approaches; managing contract accountability and reconstruction projects effectively.
(5) Management of International Financial Assistance: Streamlining the process of receiving foreign aid and funds while improving national budget systems to best utilize external funding, while prioritizing productive funding for essential projects.
(6) Transparency in Public Debt: Utilizing public debt in productive projects effectively; upholding financial and fiscal stability; implementing appropriate public financial management strategies.
(7) Coordination and Inter-Agency Collaboration: Establishing legal, institutional, and functional structures for coordination among government entities; strengthening collaboration between federal, provincial, and local governments; ensuring effective cooperation among government bodies and maintain horizontal and vertical coordination of planning, financing, and public finance management between all levels of government.
(8) Fiscal Discipline of Public Expenditure: Managing legitimate and effective external funding while maintaining fiscal responsibility, efficiency, and ensuring sustainable economic growth based on appropriations and strategic plans.

Chapter 12
State Reform and Good Governance Initiatives

12.1 Background
The constitution of Nepal aims to establish a welfare state by ensuring the rule of law, moral rights and human values, equal opportunity, proportional inclusion, federal democratic governance, citizen participation, and social justice, thereby creating a just governance system in all areas of national life. The essence of state reform and good governance has been the basis for establishing a welfare state. Over time, the scope and mandate of state reform have been expanding. If the overall expectations of the citizens’ development and welfare are incorporated into the agenda of state reform, the objectives set by the constitution can be achieved effectively. It is also necessary to include the state reform process as a critical aspect from which the state can derive its indicative measures.

The essence of good governance needs to be characterized by transparency, legality, accountability, integrity, and effective action in political, administrative, and social realms. Strengthening the relationships between federal governments, provinces, and local levels to promote rights, accountability, and effective coordination is essential. The services provided by the state must ensure equal and easy access, while maintaining the dignity of citizens. 

12.2 Current Status
Since the promulgation of the constitution, two rounds of elections have been conducted through the electoral system at the federal, provincial, and local government levels. All levels of government have completed their initial terms and entered their subsequent phases, establishing a federal democratic republic. Public participation in politics has been increasing inclusively. Consequently, the establishment of democratic governance has led to the promotion of good governance. 

The initiatives for ensuring good governance require necessary legal and structural frameworks, citizen engagement, and group rights recognition. There is an expectation of improving the various dimensions and indicators of governance included in the 15th plan (FY 2081/82 - 2085/86), which is reflected in the enhancement related to governance indicators. However, comparisons reveal that the governance indicator targets outlined in the previous annual plan (FY 2080/81) have not been effectively met in FY 2079/80, showing a notable decline instead. The indicators regarding government effectiveness, corruption control, voice and accountability, regulatory quality, and political stability have demonstrated inadequate progress. 

Nepal's challenges concerning corruption have been linked to the systematic corruption in governance structures, which, accompanied by effective legal provisions, have been implemented through national strategies and action plans, including the 2069 (2012) initiatives. To combat the growing political corruption and bias against all ethnic minorities, it is necessary to create frameworks for action and implement international treaties, including policies regarding minority rights and citizen rights. 

To maintain a system of governance that promotes accountability, transparency, and effective service provision among the three tiers of government in Nepal, a comprehensive legal and institutional framework must be developed, supported by intergovernmental coordination and bridge communication.

Environmental Sustainability, Climate Change, and Green Economy  
13.1 Background  
A healthy society and sustainable development are fundamentally linked to environmental sustainability, pollution management, climate resilience, disaster risk reduction, and sustainable economic development. Proactive management of natural resources, sustainable utilization of forest products, environmental sustainability, energy transition, development of green infrastructure, and creating opportunities for sustainable livelihoods are necessary for Nepal. While climate change has emerged as a core issue for the global community, Nepal requires sustainable, inclusive, and environmentally sound practices to safeguard its natural resources.  
Nepal contributes minimally to the global greenhouse gas emissions that are the primary drivers of climate change. However, the late melting of snow, local air pollution, and pollutants from brick kilns, vehicular emissions, cooking stoves, biomass burning, and wildfires in Nepal and South Asian countries pose significant risks. The detrimental effects of climate change have now led to broader and more intense vulnerability across various sectors in Nepal. The country’s unique geographical location, reliance on monsoon rains, climate-sensitive livelihoods, and the global climate change regime heighten Nepal's vulnerability and risks. Most vulnerable to climate-induced shocks are marginalized communities, small farmers, Dalits, indigenous populations, and the elderly. Ensuring the right to a clean environment is imperative in addressing the core tenets of Nepal’s climate sensitivity in development management. By enhancing sustainable environmental governance and climate resilience, Nepal will serve as a prominent example in international forums.  
13.2 Current Status  
Climate-responsive indicators in Nepal indicate a continued increase in climate-related disasters like droughts and floods, along with an increase in the occurrence and intensity of rainfall. The rising temperatures have amplified hazards such as landslides, flooding, and droughts, exacerbating the impact on agricultural productivity, drinking water, and ecosystems.  
Increasing pollution in urban areas, particularly in Kathmandu Valley, has posed significant challenges to public health, endangering the right to a clean environment. Unauthorized urbanization, unmanaged industrial development, increasing forest fires, and chemical fertilizer usage have aggravated environmental contamination, impacting biodiversity and natural resources. Due to the degraded and polluted environment, the risks involved in solid waste management have also intensified. Many households still depend on firewood and other pollutants for cooking.  
Excessive exploitation of natural forests has led to a massive decline in forest resources due to the loopholes in existing legal frameworks. There is a lack of entrepreneurial incentives for forest conservation and issues with environmental assessments and logging permissions. Collaboration is lacking within community forestry management, and there exists a disconnect between federal and provincial forest management frameworks. Mining materials from rivers lead to location-specific flooding while mining stones and gravel for construction has increased risks of flooding around those extraction sites. Multiple questions concerning unsustainable practices, lack of environmental permits for buildings, and excessive charging of fines remain unresolved.  
Effective and sustainable management of natural resources seems crucial for the development of Nepal. Currently, about 23,000 community forest user groups collectively manage approximately 2.2 million hectares of forest land, accounting for 45% of Nepal's region, demonstrating recognized achievements on international platforms.

Jaistrawak Shtravastrivia, climate adaptation, and green economy. 237 Twenty ecological conservation units are contributing to the national economy through ecological environmental restoration. Forests and ecological units in Nepal hold high potential for environmental balance, ecological restoration, and climate adaptation through provisions of timber, herbal products, forest produce, and ecotourism. The in-country development has a plan to provide domestic clean energy by turning to electric vehicles as a result of increasing demand for four-wheeled vehicles powered by electricity rather than fossil fuels. Thus, Nepal has become a land of possibilities for creating alternative energy systems and concepts.

Nepal is a source of ecological restoration, climate adaptation through integrated federal management structures, major agreements like the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement. The National Climate Action Plan, 2076, and other legislative measures such as the Environmental Protection Act, 2076, and the Local Adaptation Framework, 2076, have been implemented, along with the Climate Change and Community Framework (2077-2087). The Second Nationally Determined Contribution and National Adaptation Plan is necessary for assessing these strategies. In this way, the National Climate Disaster Response and Risk Assessment Report, 2079, and the Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy, 2079, have been approved. Strategies prioritizing climate change mitigation and adaptation and targeted initiatives are being implemented.

In the fiscal year 2068/69, the national budget has been practicing climate indicators, and it has been decentralized to the province levels. Local climate adaptation strategies and plans have also been prepared, while about 263 local bodies are implementing the local adaptation plans. For the reduction and adaptation targets, a support agreement amounting to 87 million USD has been reached, besides three domestic institutions receiving approval for national support. Meanwhile, a deal worth 45 million USD has been struck with the World Bank for carbon trade.

Among two countries with large economies and populations, there is a distinct geographical and physical classification, natural beauty, forest and ecological systems, water resource availability, heritage and cultural assets, social and cultural values, and expressions are potential references for natural and inclusive economies.

Easy Graduation and Sustainable Development Goals Implementation from Least Developed Countries  
14.1 Background  
Self-reliance, independence, progressive and prosperous economic development is crucial. By 2026, Nepal is expected to graduate from the group of least developed countries. The graduation will not only elevate the stature of Nepal and Nepalis but will also create new opportunities. However, there will be a need for effective utilization of these opportunities. Currently, Nepal faces a reduction and decrease in some aid and support from other countries. Hence, there is a need for strategic planning to effectively manage the impact of this reduction. The goal is to make the graduation irreversible and sustainable, enabling the country to transition to a high-middle-income nation by 2043 while focusing on domestic economic growth and sustainable development. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) accepted as a universal agenda outline the targets for Nepal. The implementation of the SDGs, which are fundamental to Nepal's long-term vision, is being systematically integrated and managed. 
The SDGs envision an end to poverty, zero hunger, good health, quality education, and other targets, but the COVID-19 pandemic, global economic downturn, climate change, and other disasters have negatively impacted progress toward these goals. Despite challenging conditions, effective implementation of the SDGs and associated initiatives must ensure continued progress.
14.2 Current State  
(a) Graduation from Least Developed Countries  
The indicators for graduation from least developed to developing countries are: (1) Gross National Income per Capita, (2) Human Asset Index (HAI), and (3) Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI). Nepal achieved the required minimum levels for two of these indicators (HAI and EVI) in 2015. Based on the assessment from 2015 and 2018, Nepal was eligible for graduation in 2021. The impacts of the 2015 devastating earthquake and subsequent natural calamities impacted the Gross National Income indicator, causing a delay in graduation. A recent valuation in 2021 has determined that Nepal is likely to graduate in 2026. The economic impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected both economic and social activities, postponing readiness by an additional two years, but the necessary preparations are underway. As per the assessments from 2015, 2018, 2021, and projections for 2024, the indicators related to graduation for developing nations as well as the status of Nepal in relation to that progress are outlined in Table 14.1.  
Table 14.1: Indicators related to Graduation to Developing Nations

Easy Graduation and Sustainable Development Goals Implementation from Least Developed Countries | 251 The expected impacts of graduation for Nepal include international development assistance management strategies, unified trade strategy for 2080 AD, and other integrated strategies for smooth transition from least developed to developing status. By the time of graduation in 2026, Nepal must align its Gross National Income with the graduation threshold, along with enhancements in the Human Asset Index and economic and environmental indicators. The necessary development plans should emphasize this alignment and progression.  
(b) Initial Steps towards Sustainable Development Goals  
Nepal has begun integrating the Sustainable Development Goals into its legal and institutional frameworks as per the country's economic, social, and environmental context. Hence, the budget and implementation of programs have been aligned with the SDGs. The SDGs have been localized through integration into medium-term plans, provincial and local plans. The entire government and community are working towards achieving the SDGs, ensuring cooperation among government, private sector, cooperatives, civil society, and development partners to meet these targets by 2030. An impactful assessment of resources and implementations strategy is in place to achieve the required SDG targets. By 2022, about 40% progress toward the 2030 goals has been achieved. The dimensions of all SDG indicators need to be articulated into the implementation process, including existing institutional arrangements to facilitate further advancements.  
14.3 Key Issues and Challenges

(2) Implementing comprehensive and effective measures: Considering the economic downturn and high inflation rates in light of the impact of COVID-19 and current international economic adversities, Nepal may struggle to achieve a rapid recovery. Graduation strategies must prioritize sustainable development, employment creation, equity, health, and education improvement. Comprehensive economic adjustment measures must account for the changing dynamics of macroeconomic factors.  
(3) Mitigating the impact on international trade: Achieving graduation from least developed countries during a time of unprecedented economic contraction demands advanced trade strategies, especially in ensuring that Nepal's products gain access to important markets, particularly in Europe, USA, China, Japan, Canada, Australia, and South Korea. Immediate steps must be taken to facilitate trade agreements with developed countries.  
(4) Managing the impacts of developmental assistance sources: Post-graduation, the availability of international development assistance may decline. More efforts are needed to secure funding from alternative developmental finance sources and appropriate identification of new strategic financing partnerships to navigate the transition.  
(5) Generating employment opportunities: Economic activity, international support, and development management impacts need to be evaluated regarding employment. The study of commodities and services with potential in trade must be pursued to stimulate further employment opportunities.  
(6) Availability of resources: Securing adequate resources for the attainment of SDGs remains a formidable challenge. Identifying and mobilizing additional resources through effective economic diplomacy is vital for successful implementation.  
(7) Localizing the SDGs: The local essence of the Sustainable Development Goals must be embraced, ensuring coordination among federal, provincial, and local governments and institutions while monitoring and evaluating the implementation at various administrative levels.  
(8) Fostering collaboration and partnerships: As the success of the Sustainable Development Goals relies on collective action from various stakeholders, facilitating partnerships and collaborations among government, NGOs, cooperatives, civil society, and private sectors is crucial for success.  
(9) Ensuring sustainable and robust systems of monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals is essential. Effective tracking of progress and sustaining committed efforts need to be achieved to adapt and identify the impact of policies and intended results.  
14.4 Transformative Strategies
