Introduction  
1.1 Background 
Nepal has made significant achievements in economic, social, and physical infrastructure development through more than six decades of planned development efforts. The periodic plans have continuously adapted to changes in the political system and governance structure, reinforcing the goals, directions, priorities, and strategies of planned economic development. 
Under Nepal's constitution, the federal democratic republican governance system aims to fulfill the aspirations of the people, ensuring good governance, development, and prosperity. Emphasizing the protection of fundamental rights, the roles of state actors and citizens, and ensuring social justice and equality are essential to establishing an inclusive, sustainable, and cooperative society. The state's economic objective is to create an equitable and prosperous economy focusing on self-reliance and empowerment. The long-term vision towards the target "Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali" has been established up to 2100. With the aim of transitioning Nepal from a least developed country to a developing country by the year 2083 (2026), the plan focuses on achieving goals of sustainable development by the year 2087 (2030). Since the ongoing implementation of the 15th Plan (FY 2076/77-2080/81) is set to finish by the end of FY 2081, this sixteenth plan is created as a continuation for the subsequent five years (FY 2081/82-2085/86). 
1.2 Brief Review of Planned Development Efforts 
The journey of planned development in Nepal began with the launch of the first Five-Year Plan (2013/14 - 2017/18) under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister through the National Planning Commission. Prior to 2046, plans were implemented during the Panchayat regime, including the Second Plan (FY 2019/20-2021/22). After the restoration of multiparty democracy in 2046, the federal form of governance was established, leading to the implementation of successive plans including the Eighth Plan (FY 2049/50-2053/54) up until the current Sixteenth Plan (FY 2081/82-2085/86).
With the establishment of the federal democratic republican governing system in 2072, the Fourth Plan (FY 2073/74-2075/76) was implemented accordingly. Following this, a new federal structure emerged via local elections in all provinces, allowing the launch of the Fifth Plan (FY 2076/77-2080/81) and respective first provincial plans, establishing frameworks for local planning. 
The economic years 2018/19, 2047/48, and 2048/49 saw significant planning achievements. The second to eleventh plans incorporated key aspects concerning national economic governance. 
The First Plan (2013/14-2017/18) aimed at achieving growth in production, employment, and poverty alleviation, taking significant steps in economic infrastructure and social service development. This plan greatly contributed to establishing essential infrastructure such as agriculture, roads, and electricity critical for economic service and growth.
The Second Plan (2019/20-2021/22) focused on developing the economic base, labor market, and infrastructure, emphasizing agriculture, industrial growth, and social service improvement.
The Third Plan (2022/23-2026/27) prioritized establishing a just economic order, emphasizing agriculture productivity, trade development, industrial growth, and addressing inequality, alongside agricultural infrastructure development.
The Fourth Plan (2027/28-2031/32) aimed at advancing production, communications, and industrial development.
The Fifth Plan (2032/33-2036/37) emphasized production, effective labor utilization, and economic sustainability. 
The Sixth Plan (2037/38-2041/42) aimed to create productive employment and full economic utilization, particularly focusing on infrastructure development in agriculture, small industries, and service sectors.
The Seventh Plan (2042/43-2046/47) built on the successes of the Sixth Plan, emphasizing rural economic integration and sustainable employment.
The Eighth Plan (2049/50-2053/54) initiated comprehensive economic reforms post-reinstatement of multiparty democracy, focusing on sustainable development and addressing inequality.
The Ninth Plan (2054/55-2058/59) targeted agricultural sustainability and social equality alongside economic growth and welfare.
The Tenth Plan (2059/60-2063/64) focused on public collaboration with local bodies to achieve sustained good governance and optimize shared resources.
The Eleventh Plan (2064/65-2066/67) aimed to transition towards a prosperous and just Nepal with strong economic reform policies promoting social harmony and effective economic policy.

Production, Productivity, and Competitive Growth | 67 Section 3
Production, Productivity, and Competitive Growth  
3.1 Background
To make the national economy independent, robust, and self-sufficient, it is essential to identify the available production resources across the country and achieve production and productivity growth through their effective utilization. Mobilizing all sectors of the economy sustainably and competitively to enhance the production of high-quality goods and ensure efficient service delivery is crucial for improving the quality of life of ordinary citizens. In terms of the country’s economic growth and prosperity, sectors like agriculture, industry, energy, forestry, tourism, education, health, etc., hold significance, and the effective mobilization of capital, infrastructure, labor, and land resources is important for achieving growth in production, productivity, and competitive growth. 
The production of primary crops and the efficient utilization of resources, productivity in agriculture and livestock, effective utilization of raw materials scientifically and industrially, sustainable self-sufficiency of the economy is necessary. Service sectors, which are primary and secondary, should be developed as a tool to enhance the efficient functioning of the agricultural economy. The products produced by the primary sector will be utilized as resources in the secondary sector, and the products from both the primary and secondary sectors will be used by the tertiary sector, thus establishing front and back linkages. Overall, the coordinating efforts of the economic development sectors need to be unified and interconnected to foster concern towards production, productivity, and competitive growth in the economy. Therefore, it is imperative for state policies to highlight these aspects.
3.2 Current Situation
Nepal's agricultural sector, according to the productivity and cooperatives sector, emphasizes the sustainable use of land in conjunction with the principles of good governance, leading towards a long-term vision for development. By 2100, the nation aims to commercialize the agricultural sector and establish a robust repurposing of industry and services based on clean, renewable, and high-value resource utilization, driving production and productivity forward. It is estimated that, under the preparation plan, primary, secondary, and tertiary sector contributions to the economy will average 24.1%, 17.6%, and 58.3% respectively; by the fiscal year 2079/80, these sectors contributed 24.6%, 13.0%, and 62.4% respectively to the economy. Efforts taken in the agricultural sector have led to the productivity of major crops reaching 3.42 metric tons per hectare by the fiscal year 2079/080. Among the irrigable lands, around 25% has achieved sustainable irrigation systems. 
The mixed sector of agriculture is becoming increasingly commercialized, with significant developments in the hilly and mountainous regions, cash crops, and agro-tourism. The production target for major staple crops has not been met due to inadequate yields, although the production of wheat, rice, millet, and maize is approaching targets. Additionally, the self-sufficiency level of fish, meat, eggs, and dairy is gradually improving in the national economy. The goal for the essential goods contribution of agriculture (agricultural produce, livestock, and food products) in total income was targeted at 5%, but it has remained at 15%. 
The contribution of the productive industrial sector to total GDP was aimed at 6.5% according to the fifth plan, whereas it reached 5.3% in the fiscal year 2079/80. The establishment and operational legality related to the construction of processing and industrial facilities and areas for industries has been streamlined. The tourism sector contributes 2.0% to total GDP, with around 2 million jobs being related to tourism. In 2023, the sector earned $548.1 million in foreign currency. By the fiscal year 2079/80, the anticipated national power generation from hydropower and alternative energy sources was 2877 megawatts and direct use was estimated at 380 kilowatts/hour. Overall, 15 million infrastructure was constructed to provide effective irrigation for 55 thousand hectares. The irrigation policy of 2080 has emphasized the overall sustainable use of water resources and constructed numerous multi-purpose rich irrigation systems in the rural wringing areas. 
The significant role of cooperatives and non-government organizations has contributed towards resource mobilization, skilled labor, infrastructure improvement, job creation, entrepreneurship development, revenue generation, and market accessibility. However, due to inadequate regulation and management in cooperatives, issues like capital retention and poor governance have emerged in saving and loan cooperative institutions.

58 | Sixteenth Plan (FY 2081/82 - 2085/86) (g) Long-term Source Management of Investments: The plan aims for economic growth levels with total investment expected to be NPR 94 billion 82 million 66 crores (at fiscal year 2080/81 prices). 
The plan considers the need for investment to be complemented by resources obtained from government and financial institutions, as well as private sources. Since traditional sources of funding can only meet a portion of the required investment, new alternative sources have been identified for operational management. Traditional sources will comprise government revenues, foreign aid, commercial loans, and funds generated from share capital and domestic investment, while alternative sources will include foreign investments, private-public partnerships, blended finances, income from natural resource exploitation, climate finance, carbon credits, and other avenues available for public institutions.  
(ṅ) Consumption, Savings, and Capital Formation: In line with the overall economic strategy, savings and national consumption affect the total capital formation significantly. Hence, the sixteenth plan aims to increase gross capital formation by promoting necessary savings while minimizing unnecessary consumption. The plan estimates that gross capital formation will increase significantly, with consumer savings expected to account for an estimated 91.5% of total production, while national savings will aim for approximately 39.0% of total production. Similarly, gross capital formation is forecasted to remain at about 28.6% of total production. Government contributions to gross capital formation are projected to be 30.2%, while private contributions (including cooperatives) will be about 69.8%.

2.6.2 Government Budget  
According to the plan, good governance, social equity, and inclusive economic growth remain essential for public financing. This will involve managing domestic resources to create employment, economic productivity, and improve economic growth. Therefore, government budget estimates indicate NPR 120 billion 63 million 32 crores will be dedicated to fiscal planning. Within this estimate, NPR 45 billion 71 million 79 crores will be earmarked for current expenditures, NPR 27 billion 71 million 4 crores for capital expenditures, NPR 22 billion 57 million 75 crores for financial arrangements, and NPR 24 billion 62 million 74 crores for grants. A significant public revenue source is anticipated to derive from federal revenues contributing about NPR 84 billion 65 million 15 crores. Total distributable revenues are projected at NPR 95 billion 30 million 60 crores.  
In the context of the plan, NPR 17 billion 52 million 30 crores will likely come from external aid. The plan also estimates that the revenue and aid will generate not less than NPR 18 billion 42 million 2 crores through internal lending. Details of government financing are mentioned in Table 2.8.

2.6.4 External Sector  
During the sixteenth plan, various indicators related to the external sector of the economy are projected positively. The planned policies are expected to strengthen these indicators further, enabling improvements in some challenging areas of foreign trade. While challenges exist regarding moving from LDC to emerging market status, efforts will be made to reduce trade deficits through effective management of trade and income flows. It is estimated that the total trade deficit (merchandise and services) will be around 22.5% of total GDP by the end of the plan. The targets for income and revenue (merchandise and services) are set to be 8.5% and 31.0%, respectively.  
With a positive outlook for the external sector, it is projected that foreign direct investment (FDI) will reach approximately 200 billion NPR by the plan completion, with the improvement of revenue from merchandise and services expected to become substantial.

Chapter 13  
Climate Change and Natural Resource Management 

13.1 Background  
A healthy society and prosperous nation depend on environmental management, waste regulation, climate resilience, disaster risk reduction, and sustainable natural resource management, quality development, and protection of biodiversity. Sustainable management of natural resources as well as systematic institutional management can contribute significantly to the overall wellbeing and economic activities of the nation. Declining climate resilience in the global community reflects the need for sustainable and ecological approaches towards all aspects of development for Nepal.  

Global climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions has made Nepal's contribution negligible amidst major industrial pollution in the region. In South Asia, the burning of fossil fuels particularly from heavy industries, brick kilns, vehicles, wood stoves, straw fires, and forest fires have contributed to local air quality degradation. The multitude of climatic impacts has posed severe challenges to the nation’s overall developmental landscape and ecosystem resilience. Nepal's unique geographical setting, dependency on monsoonal water recharging, reliance on natural resources, and limited adaptation and resilience strategies, all contribute to the increasing threat posed by global climate change. This entails that particularly marginalized communities, small-scale farmers, women, children, and elderly populations are increasingly faced with the disparities in natural resource access. The moral right to live in a clean environment is being increasingly threatened, and hence the management of climate-sensitive resources along with environmental justice becomes critically imperative in light of Nepal's sensitivity to an increasingly challenging climate scenario. Integrating environmental management with climate adaptation is crucial, and international actions can propel Nepal to be an example for the community.  

13.2 Current Status  
Changes in climate-sensitive indicators related to rainfall, water availability, glacial melting, and monsoonal trends suggest that Nepal is becoming more vulnerable with the threat of increasing glacial retreat and rising incidence of glacial disasters. With increasing glacial melt and higher frequency of rains during the glacial season, the likelihood and recurrence of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), landslides, flooding, and droughts are on the rise. Cheng of natural water resources due to shrinking surface sources is an urgent matter affecting food security and access to clean water, sanitation, energy, and overall ecosystem stability.  

In urban areas, pollution rates have led to severe challenges in the quality of life and access to clean environments. Unregulated urbanization and encroachment upon natural habitats further exacerbate the pressure on environmental integrity. Therefore, the systemic challenges lie both in management capacity and engagement with scientific knowledge to promote resources that foster ethical and sustainable environments.  

Given the challenges posed by other sectors, sustainable natural resource management has been identified as a critical element for Nepal's development advantages. Forest resource management is paramount for the country's sustainability landscape yet faces significant challenges stemming from illegal logging, uncertain policies, and institutional disparities. Transitioning towards better governance structures that enables participatory practices will play a key role in tackling these issues. 

It is worth noting that rapid urban growth and industrialization continue to impose additional burdens on the already overstressed natural resource management system in Nepal. Comprehensive regulation and environmentally sound practices across all levels are extremely vital for transitioning towards sustainable management models.


Productive Employment, Migration Labor, and Social Security | 87 Chapter 4
Productive Employment, Migration Labor, and Social Security
4.1 Background
The Constitution of Nepal provides for the right to life with dignity along with the rights to social security and labor employment. The productivity of labor, through effective management and investment, seeks to ensure productive employment, decent work, and social security. The end goal is to reduce human vulnerability through inclusionary economic growth and national development goals. The provision of decent work entails securing employment, a sustainable livelihood, equal pay for equal work, social security, establishing fair labor relations, respecting the dignity of all workers, eradicating all forms of labor exploitation, enforcing labor rights and rights at work, occupational safety and health, and the necessary measures for compliance. Utilizing the demographic dividend of the country's working population to foster self-reliance requires innovative policies tailored to the needs of the labor market, aiming to enhance national production and productivity. It is essential to establish adequate social security provisions for vulnerable populations, contributing to equitable and comprehensive social protections.

With a growing number of employment opportunities across the country, youth will continue to seek foreign employment for some time. Addressing this involves securing, managing, and enhancing decent work by identifying and entering into labor agreements with emerging destination countries that have favorable labor market conditions. To curb the compulsory state of seeking foreign employment, dignified earnings, knowledge, skills, experience, competency, work ethics, professionalism, entrepreneurship, and self-confidence need to be channeled productively. This mandates collaborative efforts from the government to create opportunities for internal employment. It is crucial to regulate informal employment and caregiving work as well. The goals of decent work and economic development require harnessing the poverty alleviation grants that Nepal has been receiving alongside national productivity efforts through productive investments acquired from abroad.

88 | Sixteenth Plan (Fiscal Year 2081/82 - 2085/86) 4.2 Current Status
The Constitution emphasizes creating an enabling environment for the development of the country's labor potential, encouraging collaboration between workers and entrepreneurs, expanding the scope of social security, making productive labor transitions, and utilizing capital, skills, context, and experience gained from foreign employment in the domestic arena. Additionally, it aims to ensure opportunities for decent work for everyone. The Constitution recognizes employment, social security, and labor rights as fundamental human rights. International labor organization standards and development goals have ensured decent and productive work, inclusive social protections, and labor productivity improvement. Various labor laws have been implemented for managing both domestic and international employment, including the Bonded Labor Act-2078, Trade Union Act-2049, Foreign Employment Act-2064, Employment Rights Act-2075, Contribution-Based Social Security Act-2074, Labor Act-2074, National Employment Policy-2071, and the Foreign Employment Policy-2068. Periodic amendments to these laws and policies are being reviewed in light of new directions. Furthermore, efforts are underway to promote sustainable domestic employment while ending forced migration into foreign employment, combining the dual purpose of ensuring meaningful social security and skill development among the workforce.

According to the National Population Census 2078, the productive age group (15-59 years) comprises 67% of Nepal's population. This demographic dividend is expected to remain intact up until the year 2103. However, trends indicate that the youth are increasingly moving toward foreign employment. Key issues affecting the internal job market include a decline in employment opportunities, imbalances between labor demand and supply, underutilization of skilled labor, a lack of respect for work, high levels of informal employment, marginalization of local labor, and ineffective labor regulations and policies. This situation leads to the rise of foreign labor influx and marginalization of domestic labor. According to labor providers based on the standards of the International Labor Organization, the unemployment rate stands at 11.4%. Currently, 36.5% of the working population is engaged in formal work, while the participation rate of the working age population is 38.5%. The informally employed population shows a staggering sixfold increase compared to the formally employed sector. Efforts have been initiated to regulate informal employment and related caregiving tasks. Although there is a downward trend in the overall incidence of child labor, around 11 million children aged 5-13 are still engaged in household labor, with an estimated 2 million involved in hazardous work.

9 | Productive Employment, Migration Labor, and Social Security | 89
The overall approach to addressing child labor has led to the implementation of the National Master Plan for the Elimination of Child Labor 2075-2085, which promotes child labor-free local communities.

By the fiscal year 2079/80, a total of 14 local municipalities have been declared child labor-free. As efforts to expand the coverage of social security through contribution-based systems grow, the number of workers and employers in this sector is increasing. As of the end of fiscal year 2080, according to the National Economic Census 2075, out of 9,23,356 establishments in Nepal, 18,847 establishments and 12,80,888 workers have registered under the social security scheme. The number of establishments participating in the social security system is expanding in line with the rising demand for labor. According to labor service providers, about 15% of workers are included in this coverage. While the 15th plan aims for 60% of the population to be covered by social security, around 32% is estimated to have been achieved. Of the federal government budget for the fiscal year 2080, 14.8% has been allocated for social security projects. Programs related to social security have been initiated by provincial governments and local bodies. In this context, the ongoing increase in employment creation is being promoted through collective efforts and streamlined functioning within social security schemes.

The labor market lacks a cohesive index for available workforce resources and employment opportunities. As there has been an inability to coordinate between the influx of job seekers entering the labor market and the available opportunities, many workers are migrating for foreign employment. In economic year 2079/80, 771,327 Nepalis have sought new and renewed labor approval for foreign employment. Approximately 57% of households in the country depend on remittance income, and during this period, around NRs. 12 billion has been earned through remittances. This figure represents approximately 23% of total gross domestic product. Among those seeking foreign employment, the number of skilled workers is notably increasing. Foreign employment is affecting family dynamics, economic structures, and raising social inequities. To ensure security, manage sustainable employment, and create decent work opportunities, bilateral labor agreements have been signed with 12 labor destination countries.

Prime Minister’s Message  
The Sixteenth Plan has been prepared in a timely manner, focusing on the country's economic, social, and environmental development. With the establishment of the federal democratic republic, political leadership has now been centralized around issues of economic development and prosperity. Economic, social, and infrastructure development activities have increased up to this point under the various governments. The entrepreneurship and business skills of the people have also developed.  
Through the 67 years of planning and development efforts, significant achievements have been made in the areas of economic, social, and infrastructural development through the endeavors undertaken among various sectors. However, the overall achievements against the country's developmental needs, citizens’ expectations, and available resources and potentials are still low. The traditional practices of governance along with the age-old tradition of policy formulation and implementation will not yield the goals according to the current national development needs. In this context, it is necessary to create an environment where the objectives set by the planning commission can be achieved by providing new direction and effectively implementing the development practices that have been adopted so far.  
The landscape of the country, the nature of its geography, the aspirations of citizens, the good relations initiated in international affairs, the equitable development of all segments of the population, and ensuring good governance, prosperity, and justice should be the solid pillars for effectively implementing the developmental plans.  
The planning process must be ambitious enough to implement achievable objectives to address the challenges posed by various sectors requiring cooperation from all sides.  
The plan has taken into account the experiences and feedback from the implementation of various plans, emphasizing “good governance, social justice and prosperity” in the context of producing development results and creating jobs in an integrated manner. It is expected that this Sixteenth Plan will initiate a new chapter in the country's overall development. It aims to elevate Nepal to a developing country status by the year 2026 and expects to achieve significant results in poverty reduction and unemployment elimination by 2030, while extending access to education, health, and social security to remote populations.  
In the end, I urge all stakeholders to contribute to the effective implementation of this Sixteenth Plan, which aims to bring positive change to the lives of citizens. I would like to express my gratitude to the National Planning Commission, and all associated individuals for their involvement in the preparation of this plan.  
Thank you.

Message  
Nepal has been practicing planning and development for nearly five decades. During this time, ten five-year plans and five annual plans have been developed and implemented. The 12th Plan, which is based on the long-term vision "Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali," is nearing its end this fiscal year 2080/81. Therefore, the Sixteenth Plan has been developed to be implemented from fiscal year 2081/82 to 2085/86. This plan promotes the theme of "good governance, social justice, and prosperity," aiming to maintain continuity in the efforts and policies established in previous plans.  
This plan identifies the fundamental issues and challenges related to our development and prosperity, providing strategic guidance for resolution.  
Among the objectives set in previous plans, social indicators have shown significant progress while the targets related to economic growth and development have fallen short. Long delays have plagued the implementation of various plans, leading to inconsistencies in achieving economic growth targets and indicators. The initial implementation phase of the 13th Plan was heavily affected by external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as internal structural problems, making it difficult to achieve the targets set in previous plans. The experiences gained from previous plan implementations have been incorporated into the Sixteenth Plan.  
This Sixteenth Plan is made to be actionable, realistic, and efficient, and is presented in a format that gives strategic guidance for overall national development. To address the various structural challenges faced in development, transformative strategies and primary initiatives are included in this plan by the Government of Nepal and the National Planning Commission at Singha Durbar, Kathmandu.  
Additionally, enhancement of inter-sectoral linkages and stakeholder collaboration is being emphasized in the plan's implementation; mainstreaming gender in all development dimensions, utilizing local knowledge, ensuring environmental sustainability, and minimizing disaster risks are being integrated. A comprehensive strategy has been developed focusing on policy formulation and implementation based on evidence.  
In this context, I express my gratitude for the guidance from the honorable Prime Minister and the Chair of the Commission. Similarly, I would like to extend my appreciation to all the stakeholders, including government officials, political parties, experts, academics, and development partners, who have provided valuable feedback and supported the plan's development. Furthermore, I wish to thank all members of the National Planning Commission, the technical team, and staff who tirelessly contributed to the process of formulating this plan.

Quality Infrastructure Development, Sustainable Development and Integrated Internal Resources  
6.1 Background  
The role of quality infrastructure development and its sustainable resources in the overall national development of the country is significant. These resources include energy, transport, sanitation, waste management, and information infrastructure, which are the backbone of economic development. With a resilient, quality, environmentally friendly, climate-sensitive, green, inclusive and equitable infrastructure, production and productivity can increase, consequently enhancing the national income. The importance of renewable energy resources is highlighted in the context of sustainable development and climate adaptation. In this regard, the development of multi-dimensional forms of infrastructure, river management structures, sanitation and energy resources can be improved and strengthened through the effective use of information technology and integrated resource development.  
To connect rural settlements with markets and facilitate activities related to industries, tourism, agriculture, and energy, an integrated infrastructure management system along with communication and information technology is vital. Under the government’s framework, integrated management among energy, transport, sanitation, drinking water, forestry, environment, climate change adaption, communication and information technology for development is critical. The first five-year plan (2013-2018) focused on prioritizing investment in infrastructure sectors (transport, agriculture, energy, and sanitation). Past development efforts have prioritized access and utility of the infrastructure; however, there is now an increasing need to pay attention to the environmental sustainability and climate resilience dimensions of infrastructure development. Similarly, strengthening national and international connectivity through information technology is a priority of this plan to support the country’s overall development approach.  
6.2 Current Status  
(1) Transport Infrastructure: The transport infrastructure network includes roads, waterways, railways, and urban transport systems. The strategic road networks, national highways, and various other highways and railway projects are currently operational. All districts in the country are connected to the national road network. As of the fiscal year 2079/80, the federal government has completed constructing 18,052 km of blacktop roads, 7,696 km of gravel roads, and 8,491 km of earthen roads, totaling 34,239 km of roads. There are 66,000 km of roads constructed by the provincial and local governments. Of the total 1,879 km of the Mid-Hill Highway, 72.7% has been completed, while approximately 90% of the 1,857 km of the Hulaki Highway has been constructed. Of the 50 km of the Sallishalla road connecting the headquarters of Humla district to Sharmkot, 38 km of the track-laying work has not been completed yet.  
(2) Bridges and Ferries: There are 942 bridges planned in national pride and transformative projects, of which only 534 have been completed so far. In light of Nepal's geographic situation, emphasis must be placed on reliable and sustainable transport connections. Currently, work is underway on the Nagdhunga tunnel and other construction projects like the Rani Jhansi, Hanuman Dhoka road. Integrated transport management initiatives have also seen the construction of suspension bridges in various locations.  
(3) Rail and Water Transport: As of the fiscal year 2079/80, 59 km of the Badidwas-Chowka railway line has completed the track laying along with 9 railway bridges. Of the 69 km Jayanagar-Janakpur-Badidwas railway line, service has started on 52 km from Jayanagar to Janakpur. The railway track construction in the Janakpur-Simara region is ongoing. The Bhathnaha-Sitamal Railway line has operational freight transport to the integrated checkpoint in Nepal. Feasibility studies for ferry services on rivers like Gandaki, Koshi, and Narayani have been completed. Additionally, projects for constructing passenger terminals and multi-modal terminals on the Koshi and Narayani rivers' transport system have been prepared.  
(4) Air Transport: Out of 54 domestic airports, 35 are in operation. Since the commencement of the Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports, none have been able to operate regularly for commercial flights. Environmental assessments for the construction of Nijgadh airport have been undertaken.  
(5) Road Traffic Management: There is a need to improve the traffic management infrastructure to ensure its effectiveness, safety, and quality. The verification process for vehicle owner permits needs simplifying to enable effective installation of embosser number plates and facilitate the management system. An integrated traffic management framework for the transportation sector has been established under the traffic management rules enacted in 2060. A vehicle toll payment system has been introduced as a service to manage traffic flows effectively.  
(6) Energy, Water Resources, and Sanitation Infrastructure: The construction and operation of transmission and transport infrastructure for energy resources have been prioritized. To date, national energy generation has reached 3,200 megawatts, with 84 megawatts awaiting connection to the national power system from alternative energy sources. Thus, approximately 96.7% of households have access to energy through the national grid, along with about 1.3% from alternative energy sources, ensuring a total of 98% access through sustainable means. The share of renewable energy in total energy is around 7.4%. As of the fiscal year 2079/80, the total length of transmission lines with a voltage of 66 kV and above has reached 5,742 kilometers. The combined capacity of substations is 8,867 MVA (Megavolt Ampere). By the end of FY 2079/80, a total of 1,478 megawatts of renewable energy has been generated, resulting in approximately nine billion rupees of revenue accumulated. During the dry season, the emphasis is on domestic power supply to meet local demands. The Water and Energy Commission is preparing water resource development plans in alignment with water supply infrastructure development. Historically, small-scale irrigation systems have facilitated irrigation and operation until now but require further expansion to support conventional infrastructure. Currently, 1.55 million hectares of land has been serviced by sustainable irrigation systems.  
By the fiscal year 2079/80, 10,237 hectares of irrigated land has been provided through tubewell irrigation, while 5,654 hectares have been irrigated through surface irrigation and 2,119 hectares through lift irrigation systems.  
(7) Communication and Information Technology: The framework of Digital Nepal is being effectively implemented to establish digitally advanced infrastructure. Broadbands have been successfully installed in all local government offices. The reach of 4G services that started through Nepal Telecom has now expanded to 66% of the land. Through the mobile network, 93.2% of the total population is reached. Internet density has reached 132.4%. As for the broadcasting sector, there are 1,188 FM radio stations and 244 television channels that have been granted permission to operate. The reach of radio among the population stands at 92%, and TV reaches about 72%.  
The government has been working to implement a single-window service delivery system. The number of government services available through this mobile app has now reached 62. The establishment of the National Cyber Security Centre is underway along with the issuance of the 2080 National Cyber Security Policy. To cater to the growing need for information technology regulation and communication amid rising digital traffic, it is crucial to implement a separate law governing the information technology sector. The Department of Printing, which functions under the Nepal government, has been initiated for secure printing provisions and their operationalization with the aim of becoming an institution of significance. Utilizing Nepal’s unique natural resources and beauties for the development of eco-tourism infrastructure has started.  
(8) Environmentally Friendly Infrastructure: The construction and operations related to infrastructure should focus on sustainable, green, and inclusive practices to ensure the natural resources like water, land, and forests are utilized without causing harm. Infrastructure such as irrigation, drinking water, roads, machinery, and storage plays a pivotal role in enhancing production and productivity and should be prioritized by local governments while meeting the expectations of potential return on investment.  
(9) River and Water Resource Management: As of now, 1,364 kilometers of riverbank protection has been implemented, bringing 12,785 hectares of land under irrigation. Additionally, risk mapping for 25 flood-prone zones has been completed through the identification of flood risk areas. The sustainable use of these water resources requires an understanding of existing natural resource management and water resource development.  
(10) Water supply and sanitation: The government is working towards ensuring municipal supply of clean drinking water access for the entire population. As of the fiscal year 2079/80, 95% of the population has access to drinking water, while sanitation facilities exist for 96% of the population. Nevertheless, increased public and sustainable drinking water accessibility should advance along with ensuring cleaner water in underprivileged regions. Regardless of efforts made, challenges persist due to unmanaged urban settlements, rampant urbanization, and depletion of water natural resources exacerbated by climate change-related impacts.  
(11) Housing and Urban Development: The government is aiming to address housing and urban infrastructure needs for all by promoting national and international investments. Despite the steps taken by local governments, effective implementation of infrastructural standards remains a challenge. The development of urban infrastructure must be quality-focused, safe, inclusive, sustainable, and equitable, but there is still a need to adopt an integrated approach across all stakeholders for city planning.

(c) Marginal Capital Productivity Ratio and Investment: In the Sixteenth Plan, a high economic growth rate will be aimed for by investing in government, private, and cooperative sectors. This is expected to significantly increase capital investment and also contribute to the economy's mobilization. During this period, the capital project will be completed timely and economically which is expected to create an environment conducive to targeted achievements. The infrastructure projects initiated will mostly be completed and will be operational under this plan. The public sector investments from the union, province, and local governments will experience significant growth due to increased efficiency in public procurement.
52 | Sixteenth Plan (Fiscal Year 2081/82 - 2085/86) 
Due to the increased use of capital, forecasting suggests that the productivity of capital will significantly increase with the completion of new projects. Given that the capital productivity ratio in the plan period is estimated at 4.77:1, which suggests that the targeted maximum economic growth rate in the Sixteenth Plan is set at an average of 7.1% (at constant prices). The estimation requires a total fixed capital investment of Rs. 94 billion 82 million for FY 2080/81 at that value. Of this, it is expected that Rs. 68 billion 25 million will be invested in the agricultural sector and Rs. 88 billion 41 million in the non-agricultural sector. When converting this total investment into current prices, it is estimated that a total of Rs. 111 billion 84 million 23 million will be required in the plan period.

**Strengthening of District and Local Economic Structures and Collaborative Development | 179 Chapter 9**  
Strengthening of District and Local Economic Structures and Collaborative Development  
9.1 Background  
The transition from a unitary governance system to a federal system has significantly impacted the structure and form of the national economy. Economic activities conducted by the federal government help forge relationships with provincial and local economies, thereby contributing to the robustness and strengthening of the national economy through the economic fabric of the provinces and local levels. The federal framework of Nepal necessitates the inclusion of economic equity, prosperity, and social justice to ensure the collaborative development and empowerment of provincial and local economies. By making the federal governance system effective, establishing coordination and synergy among all levels of government, and enhancing financial resilience with the national economy, the focus should be on reinforcing district and local economies. Strengthening district and local economies while implementing fundamental rights, integrating inclusive economic development strategies and actions, environmental sustainability, climate adaptation, qualitative and economic accountability, human resource development, local community participation, and regulatory compliance are underlined. 

The practice of federal governance has led to the identification of revenue sources, effective management, and the emergence of opportunities based on innovative resources in provincial and local sectors. Additionally, the inter-level relations and cooperatives among the federal, provincial, and local levels should facilitate the management of public funds, establishing a sustainable environment that contributes to enhancing the national economy in a progressive and cooperative manner. 

For operationalizing revenue generation at the provincial and local levels, frameworks, laws, revenue management, intergovernmental fiscal transfer regulations, and resource distribution measures have been put in place. Through the economic empowerment of provincial and local economies, to assist the national economy, internal revenue is actively utilized based on the criteria and indicators of intergovernmental financing. 

The ethos of federalism emphasizes the identification of rights and responsibilities between provincial, local, and federal governments while ensuring lawfulness and adherence. Therefore, collaborative development is anticipated in fostering economic growth and prosperity within the country. Harmonious coordination and mutual understanding are necessary among all three levels of government to pursue a collaborative economic development strategy.

9.2 Current Status  
Socially equitable and sustainable economic development through a federal governance structure has recently gained momentum, with the recent regional development plans focusing on local governments to implement effective forward-looking policies. The programs that emerge from these plans have motivated the provincial and local governments towards developing social equity, economic transformation, and self-reliance. These levels have increasingly adopted systematic and budgetary frameworks and medium-term structures, enhancing effective public administration and project management in the process. With these frameworks solidified, the efforts of local governments have become more robust and accountable.

In accordance with the ethos of federalism, the Provincial Government Operations Act, 2017; Intergovernmental Fiscal Management Act, 2017; Economic Management and Fiscal Accountability Act, 2019; and the Coordination and Intergovernmental Relations Act, 2020, have provided legislative backing that reinforces the operational vitality of local governments. With practical engagements, provincial and local governments are increasingly functioning through shared governance in socio-economic activities. Effective public service provision, management of resources, revenues, fiscal discipline, and intergovernmental fiscal control systems are being systematically established within the legal frameworks and systems.

Currently, the status of district and local economies is as follows:  
(1) **Provincial Gross Domestic Product**: There is significant disparity in the provincial gross domestic product. In the fiscal year 2022/23, Nepal’s total gross domestic product was approximately NPR 53 trillion, of which Bagmati Province contributed the highest at 36.9%. In contrast, Karnali Province contributed the lowest at 4.1%. The total gross domestic product of Karnali and Sudurpashchim Provinces is less than that of Koshi, Lumbini, and Gandaki Provinces.  
(2) **Provincial Economic Growth Rate**: The national economic growth rate in FY 2022/23 was 1.9%, with Gandaki, Lumbini, and Koshi Provinces recording growth rates of 3.3%, 2.1%, and 2.0%, respectively, which is higher than the national average. In contrast, Karnali and Sudurpashchim Provinces’ growth rates of 1.9% and 1.8% were equal to the national average, whereas the economic growth rates of Lumbini and Bagmati were lower at 1.7% and 1.4%.  
(3) **Per Capita Gross Domestic Product**: In the fiscal year 2022/23, Nepal's per capita gross domestic product was $1,399. This value amounted to $2,455 for Bagmati Province, the highest, and $875 for Sudurpashchim Province, the lowest. Gandaki Province recorded a per capita gross domestic product of $1,492, while Koshi, Lumbini, Sudurpashchim, and Karnali Provinces recorded $1,299, $1,126, $1,063, and $997, respectively.  
(4) **Consolidated Financial Data of Federal, Provincial, and Local Levels**: In fiscal year 2022/23, the consolidated data for the three levels of government totaled NPR 20 trillion, out of which federal revenue accounted for 68.2%, provincial revenue accounted for 10.1%, and local revenue accounted for 21.8%. In the previous fiscal year, the respective shares were 67.9%, 10.1%, and 22%. In fiscal year 2022/23, the breakdown comprised 65.1% for current expenditure, 25.5% for capital expenditure, and 9.4% for fiscal administration, which reflects a slight decline from the previous year when the respective shares were 67.0%, 25.7%, and 7.3%.  
(5) **Poverty and Human Development Index**: There are pronounced disparities in the multi-dimensional poverty index across the provinces. The highest multi-dimensional poverty index is recorded at 39.5% in Karnali Province, while Bagmati Province notes the lowest at 7.0%. The multi-dimensional poverty levels for Koshi, Lumbini, and other provinces include 15.9%, 24.2%, 9.6%, 18.2%, and 25.3%, respectively. Outside of Bagmati, Koshi, and Gandaki Provinces, the multi-dimensional poverty rate is higher. Similarly, there are higher levels of human development in Sudurpashchim Province, with the highest (34.2%), while Gandaki Province recorded the lowest (11.9%). The respective figures for Karnali Province, Lumbini Province, and Province No. 5 are 26.2%, 24.4%, 22.5%, 17.2%, and 12.6%. According to the Nepal Human Development Report, 2020, Bagmati and Gandaki Provinces rank highest among the provinces, with indices of 0.661 and 0.618, respectively. The indices for other regions are as follows: the Province of 5 at 0.510, Karnali Province at 0.538, Sudurpashchim Province at 0.547, Lumbini Province at 0.563, and Koshi Province at 0.580.  
9.3 Key Issues and Challenges  
(1) **Capabilities and Structures of Governance**: Effective implementation of economic accountability measures provided to provincial and local governments; reviewing the fiscal policies and evaluating their implementation; enhancing the legal framework concerning rights while addressing cooperative development of provincial and local economies; developing and implementing necessary laws for economic governance; ensuring unified economic governance across provincial and local economies to enhance operational efficiency.

### Section 5: Creation of Healthy, Skilled, and Competent Human Capital

5.1 Background  
5.2 Current Status  
5.3 Key Issues and Challenges  
5.4 Transformative Strategies  
5.5 Main Programs  
5.6 Quantitative Goals  

Healthy, skilled, and competent human capital is vital for economic transformation and development. Human capital is defined by knowledge, skills, and wellbeing. Investments in health, education, and sports promote economic growth and social welfare. Nepal's strategies provide guidance for integrating health, education, and overall human life into the vision of creating human capital. Health significantly affects productivity throughout a person’s life and influences labor force participation. Adequate human capital lays the foundation for future generations. Healthy parents provide nourishment and a healthy environment for children. Population health contributes meaningfully to long-term economic prosperity and socio-economic transformation. In this context, accessible and quality health services are essential. 

Early childhood development should be inclusive, ensuring access to quality and life-skills education in all communities, thus contributing to the overall national development strategy. Education equips the workforce with the necessary skills, promoting economic growth, social inclusion, and knowledge. It fosters innovation, increases employment opportunities, and raises productivity, leading to the overall development of society.

Physical health and structure contribute to the development of a productive workforce, along with social and cultural capital, which is key for national and international identity. A structured approach supports human capital growth through economic activities. Thus, investments in health and education are significant to create high-skilled and productive human capital.

5.2 Current Situation  
In health, by the end of fiscal year 2079/80, 80% had conducted at least four rounds of health examinations according to protocols, 79% of health workers received adequate training, 80% of children received complete vaccines, and maternal mortality rates had reached a significant point. Infant mortality rates and child mortality rates have become critical, standing at 21 and 33 per 1000 live births respectively. The maternal mortality rates, infant mortality rates, and complete vaccination rates indicate a need for improvement in health services provided through strategic plans.

The percentage of quality education in primary, secondary, and tertiary levels shows significant rates, but there remains a concerning dropout rate and insufficient performance in education. Internally, health systems have identified gaps in resources, policy enforcement, and overall education and training response. 

Aging demographics have begun to reveal varying issues including mental health challenges and rising chronic diseases. Therefore, critical interventions are necessary to align health-related indicators with policy frameworks.

5.3 Key Issues and Challenges  
(1) The provision of physical infrastructure and materials is critical for the development of health, education, and skill sectors, and employment opportunities for the youth necessitate the arrangement of essential resources and advanced equipment. There needs to be coordinated efforts to optimize investments from public and private stakeholders in providing essential health and education services.

(2) To ensure a sufficient supply of necessary labor force for national development, strategic planning is required to produce quality, behavior-aligned, and pragmatic skilled workers. This involves linking educated workforce with suitable employment opportunities while facilitating access to vocational education for youth and increasing their involvement in self-employment ventures. 

(3) Inclusive and equitable management ensuring access to quality services across all demographics is essential for strengthening human capital. 

(4) Coordinating efforts and enforcement for effective management across all sectors to achieve developmental goals and mobilization of consortia stakeholders.

(5) Service providers need to focus on effective utilization of resources in health and education through scientific innovation, enhancing efficiency through strong monitoring, and developing linkages between service provision institutions and research programs. 

(6) The effectiveness of social health insurance programs needs to be evaluated and strengthened; improving access to health services, thereby eliminating vulnerabilities in health coverage. 

(7) Engagement and commitment of service providers at all levels ensures quality, reliability, and efficiency in health and education services throughout the nation. 

(8) Robust systems for risk management concerning public health threats and establishing permanent measures at all levels of government for inclusive and effective health strategy implementation.

Strengthening of Comprehensive Economic Resources and Higher Economic Growth | 23 Paragraph 2  
Strengthening of Comprehensive Economic Resources and Higher Economic Growth  
2.1 Background  
Strengthening of comprehensive economic resources can lead to sustainable and higher economic growth. Economic growth contributes to improving quality of life indicators. Similarly, qualitative changes in human life create more demand for economic resources. To understand the status and challenges of national economic development, we can refer to comprehensive economic indicators.  
In the context of Nepal, engaging the private, public, and cooperative sectors in sustainable development is vital for building a free and robust economy. The role of the private sector in driving growth with effective utilization of resources and achieving sustainable development goals has been emphasized. By operating under established economic management frameworks, Nepal aims to transition into a middle-income country by the fiscal year 2087 (2030) with comprehensive economic growth. It is within this framework that the strengthening of comprehensive economic resources is crucial for ensuring balanced economic growth and social justice.  

2.2 Current Situation  
2.2.1 Economic Growth Rate  
In recent decades, the average annual economic growth rate in the country has been approximately 4.3 percent. The implementation of the Fifteenth Plan faced significant challenges due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which exacerbated both internal and external factors, leading to reduced economic growth. For the fiscal year 2080/81, the economic growth rate is projected to be 3.5 percent (at constant prices), and per capita income is estimated at 1456 US dollars. Agricultural production and productivity and the contribution of productive industries have not improved as expected, resulting in stagnated overall economic growth. In the fiscal year 2080/81, it is estimated that the contributions of agriculture and non-agriculture sectors to total GDP will be 24.1 percent and 75.9 percent, respectively. In the same way, the contribution of the primary sector is 24.6 percent, the secondary sector is 12.5 percent, and the tertiary sector is 62.9 percent. Overall, total consumption appears to be declining, while total savings and national savings are witnessing some improvement. However, a decrease is observed in total capital formation. In the fiscal year 2080/81, total savings are estimated at 7.6 percent of total GDP, and total national savings at 36.2 percent. The proportion of total capital formation to total GDP stands at 24.5 percent.  

2.2.2 Government Revenue  
During the fiscal year 2079/80, the total revenue collection target of the Nepalese government is met at 68.2 percent, while in terms of total GDP, it is maintained at 17.9 percent. Similarly, in terms of the total budget, the total expenditure is expected to be 79.7 percent of the total budget. Despite this, the capital expenditure has only reached 21.2 percent of the total budget, while recurrent expenditure has been managed at 61.4 percent of the total budget. The contraction in revenue alongside the challenges in foreign aid management has led to a significant imbalance in public finance management. In the fiscal year 2079/80, foreign aid growth rate is negative at 22 percent, with only 1 billion 23 million rupees being utilized. Among this, grants are at 11.8 percent, and loans are at 23.3 percent. As a result of reduced revenue collections, reliance on domestic borrowing has had to be increased. In the fiscal year 2079/80, domestic borrowing accounted for 4.8 percent of total GDP, while at the end of that year the unrepaid domestic debt reached 43.0 percent of total GDP, with domestic debt at 21.1 percent and external debt at 21.9 percent.  
With the adoption of a federal governance system, the federal government has been coordinating and collaborating in budget preparation and implementation for development. Provincial and local governments regard the national budget proposals as significant sources of funding. The Nepalese government has been transferring around 24 percent of the total budget to provincial and local governments from the federal budget. Besides, revenue distribution and single revenue rights from various taxes have been facilitating the provinces and local governments. In the coming days, the need for efficient domestic resource management and good governance practices through provincial and local governments has been identified as essential.

2.2.3 Monetary and Financial Indicators and Capital Markets  
In the early phase of the Fifteenth Plan, consumer price inflation was expected to remain contained; however, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and various internal and external pressures led to increased inflation towards the end of the period. In the fiscal year 2079/80, the national average consumer price inflation was at 7.7 percent. The growth of money supply was at 11.4 percent, while foreign currency reserves decreased by 26.1 percent. In that fiscal year, the total domestic loan was reported to increase by 8.7 percent, and the assets of banks and financial institutions grew by 12.3 percent. The amount of loans from banks and financial institutions increased by 3.8 percent. As of June 2080, the average yield of treasury bills was at 6.4 percent. The average interbank lending rate, as a monetary policy target, was recorded at 3.1 percent in June 2080. The average deposit rates of commercial banks stood at 10.0 percent, while the average rate for loans remained at 7.9 percent, and the average lending rate was at 12.3 percent. The number of banks and financial institutions had reached 11,589 by the end of June 2080. According to this ratio, the number of banks and financial institutions per total population is established at 2517. The financial sector has been growing with substantial contributions from non-banking financial institutions. Institutions like microfinance, citizen investment, social security, and rural credit have supported financial access, investment mobilization, and maintenance of financial security.  
Insurance sector growth rate was 7.9 percent for life insurance and 0.2 percent for non-life insurance as of the end of the fiscal year 2079/80. By that time, the population covered by insurance had reached 44.4 percent. In the capital market, the NEPSE index stood at 2097.1 by the end of June 2080. The number of listed companies on the Nepal Stock Exchange reached 254, with total market capitalization reaching 308.52 billion rupees.  

2.2.4 External Factors  
The ongoing trade deficit has persisted with significant pressure on the current account in the last few years, threatening the economic stability. In the fiscal year 2079/80, the current account deficit was recorded at Rs. 72 billion 16 crore, while the financial asset recorded a surplus of Rs. 2 billion 90 crore. The ratio of goods and services imports with total GDP was recorded at 7.0 percent and 34.7 percent, respectively. The total volume of goods imports decreased by 21.4 percent, standing at Rs. 1 billion 57 crore, while total goods exports decreased by 16.1 percent, standing at Rs. 16 billion 11 crore 73 crore. Overall, the trade deficit decreased by 15.5 percent, reaching Rs. 14 billion 54 crore 59 crore. The import-export price index for that year indicated an increase in export unit price by 3.4 percent while the import unit price index decreased by 5.3 percent.   
The domestic economy and the balance of external factors have significantly contributed to the situation of the trade balance in the economy, indicating that the foreign exchange earnings will reach an estimated 22.8 percent in total GDP over the fiscal year 2080/81. The total foreign direct investment in that year would amount to Rs. 777 crore. Foreign exchange reserves amounted to Rs. 15 billion 39 crore 36 crore at the end of June 2080, which covered 10 months of goods and services imports. As of June 2080, the Nepalese rupee depreciated by 2.8 percent against the US dollar and 12.9 percent against the Euro and 2.8 percent against the Japanese Yen.  

2.2.5 Informal and Non-registered Economy  
The level of informality and informal economic activities in Nepal is significantly high. Formal sectors encompass a range of informal sector activities and microenterprises that operate without registration. Families produce goods and services primarily for self-consumption while many informal economic activities continue to thrive. According to the National Economic Census 2075, among all economic establishments, 49.5 percent operated without any indication of registration, while formal establishments accounted for only 52 percent of the total economic establishments. Due to the lack of transparency in transactions associated with informal economic activities, many have not been integrated into the tax framework. Up until the fiscal year 2079/80, a total of 55,000 permanent tax identification numbers have been issued for tax purposes. In terms of labor, a significant portion falls into informal labor and employment categories. According to the Nepal Labor Force Survey 2074/75, only 15.4 percent of the labor force received formal employment in the private sector. The formal sector accounts for merely 37.8 percent of total employment.  
The informal economy also encompasses illegal production and trade, smuggling across borders, trade deficits, and other unlawful activities that the economy faces.

Effective Public Financial Management and Capital Expenditure | 207 Revenue collection and the ratio of public expenditure to total GDP in Nepal

In the context of Nepal's national revenue management and public expenditure, the period between the fiscal years 2048/49 and 2075/76 saw significant growth in government expenditure compared to the total gross domestic product. However, some decline was observed in the year 2079/80. The government's public expenditure to GDP ratio has consistently declined, with the ratio of current and capital expenditures to total GDP falling from 11% in the fiscal year 2048/49 to 4.4% in 2079/80. There is a growing trend of decreasing categories of foreign aid and an increasing share of public debt to total expenditure.

Structural issues persist in revenue collection. The contribution of each tax to the total revenue remains notably low compared to non-tax revenues. As current expenditure continues to dominate the total budget, there has been a constant diversion from capital expenditure. The capital expenditure ratio within the overall fiscal budget remains economically volatile and of poor quality. There is an increase in the proportional size of the fiscal budget relative to capital expenditure.

Smooth Transition from Least Developed Countries to Developing Countries | 249 
Implementation of Sustainable Development Goals
14.1 Background
Self-reliant, independent, progressive, and prosperous, Nepal is set to graduate from the group of least developed countries to developing countries by 2026. Along with this transition, it will bring an enhancement in the self-esteem of Nepal and Nepalis as well as the creation of new opportunities. It will require the effective utilization of these opportunities to manage the associated risks. However, Nepal currently faces challenges due to a reduction or potential decrease in international aid and development assistance. Therefore, strategic planning will be essential for the effective management of impacts due to this transition. To ensure a sustainable transition without backtracking (Irreversible and Sustainable Graduation), the long-term target is to achieve the status of upper-middle-income country by 2043, along with effective development planning to secure internal growth and competitive market presence.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), accepted as a collective agenda for global development, are relevant to Nepal's context for implementation by 2030. The operationalization of the SDGs is being managed through strategic plans and institutional arrangements that deeply align with Nepal's long-term vision. The SDGs encompass goals to eliminate poverty, achieve zero hunger, ensure healthy lives, promote quality education, etc. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and other global crises, including economic downturns and climate change, have negatively impacted the progress toward these objectives. Despite the adverse contexts, ongoing management and implementation related to the SDGs demonstrate the necessity for contextual strategies to drive progress.

14.2 Current Situation
(a) Transition from Least Developed Countries
Three indicators assess the graduation of least developed countries (1) Gross National Income (GNI) per capita (2) Human Assets Index (HAI), and (3) Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI). Nepal met the minimum criteria for two indicators (HAI and EVI) necessary for graduation by 2015. Based on the evaluations from 2015 and 2018, Nepal qualified for graduation despite the setbacks from the 2015 earthquake and other natural disasters, which delayed its process due to insufficient improvement in per capita GNI. By the 2021 evaluation, Nepal is determined to graduate from least developed status by 2026. The economic and sociopolitical impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic require additional time to reach the necessary GNI benchmarks. The projections for graduation are included in table 14.1. 

Table 14.1: Graduation Limit for Developing Country Status and Current Conditions in Nepal
Indicators	2015 Limit	Progress	2018 Limit	Progress	2021 Limit	Progress	2024 Limit	Progress
GNI Per Capita (US $)	1,248	659	1,230	745	1,222	1,027	1,306	1,300
Human Assets Index (HAI)	66	68.7	66	71.2	66	74.9	66	76.3
Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI)	≤32	26.8	≤32	28.4	≤32	24.7	≤32	29.7
Source: United Nations

The impacts of graduation from least developed status will be addressed in various sectors, including coordinated international development assistance, the unified trade strategy, and strategic implementation concerning the transition plan. With the graduation by 2026, Nepal will focus on improving human asset indicators, economic indicators, and environmental indicators in line with the goal. The development strategy will include intensified efforts to meet the GNI target set for graduation.

(b) Initial Objectives of Sustainable Development Goals
Nepal has begun to integrate the SDGs into its economic, social, and environmental development frameworks, assigning legal and institutional mechanisms. Thus, the ongoing planning includes aligning budgets and implementing projects in accord with the SDGs. Mid-term development frameworks have localized and integrated the SDGs into regional and local plans. The government, along with communities, civil society, and development partners, works together towards the successful achievement of the SDGs through coordination. The 2030 targets set these goals and result in the assessment of new and innovative resources.

Government Reform and Good Governance Initiatives | 219 Chapter 12  
Government Reform and Good Governance Initiatives  
12.1 Background  
The Constitution of Nepal aims to establish a welfare state by ensuring the rule of law, the protection of fundamental rights and human values, equality, proportional representation, inclusive participation, a federal democratic governance system, and equitable arrangements through the active participation of citizens and social justice. The mandate of government reform and good governance directly supports the establishment of a welfare state. Over time, the scope and importance of government reform have been growing increasingly significant. When incorporating the overall development and welfare expectations of citizens into the agenda of government reform, the goals set by the Constitution can be achieved. It is essential to include the concept of governance in all activities related to the public service until the death of people seeking justice. 

The guarantee of good governance requires transparency, accountability, integrity, and ethical operational systems and practices in political, administrative, fiscal, and social spheres. Strengthening the rights of governments in a federal system requires mutual cooperation, responsibility, and effective coordination among the federal, provincial, and local governments as essential components. With the state providing services, ensuring equal and easy access, and maintaining good governance is a national responsibility.

12.2 Current Situation  
Since the Constitution was enacted, two rounds of elections for the federal, provincial, and local governments have been conducted through a democratic process. All three levels of government have completed their respective terms and entered the second term. This led to the establishment of a democratic republic. Public administration is becoming increasingly inclusive. Consequently, democratic governance through public service has contributed to the establishment of good governance.

Ensuring the guarantee of good governance necessitates creating legal and institutional arrangements, citizen engagement, advocacy groups, and media infrastructure. Various dimensions and indicators of government reform and good governance are expected to reflect the expectations of the interim plan (FY 2079/80) concerning indicators of governmental governance in the upcoming fiscal year (FY 2080/81) compared to the targets measured previously in FY 2075/76. The effectiveness of government, anti-corruption measures, voice and accountability, regulatory quality, and political stability indicators are not reflected as anticipated.

In the context of Nepal’s various statutory regulations, measures have been taken to effectively implement the anti-corruption framework established by national strategy and action plans, introduced in 2069. Areas of focus include anti-corruption laws, universal access aiming at the elimination of all forms of discrimination, the protection of civil and political rights, and necessary protocols for significant international commitments. Furthermore, establishing necessary laws and institutional frameworks for monitoring and enhancing active participation in public affairs is being pursued without any research on invisible corruption.

To make the country entirely corruption-free, it is essential to restore faith in transparency through effective transaction mechanisms. Government reform aims to establish mutual cooperation, co-existence, and coordination among federal, provincial, and local governments. The Prime Minister’s Office created a governing framework involving Home Ministers, Finance Ministers, and Chief Ministers from the three levels of government. The coordination and facilitation meetings held regularly between the three levels are critical for consistency in public service and public management.

The successful collaboration of the public sector and civil service describes the achievement of the Constitution’s objective. As the public sector's contribution aims at an essential standard in public service delivery, public and private sector governance structures’ guidelines should be timely reviewed and made to be pragmatic and purposive.

12.3 Main Issues and Challenges  
(1) National security and national unity must be preserved through social harmony among citizens, communities, and groups while fostering collective inclusivity and economic development; respect for human rights must underpin the economy and governance; national strength should be built through diplomacy and economic strength while minimizing the impacts of socio-economic and cultural conflicts on citizens' lived experiences.  

(2) The process of administering government reform and good governance must create a legal framework that aligns with the constitutional rights of citizens by establishing single and collective lists of powers of governance and shared governance. It is essential to ensure accountability, structure, and streamline activities among different regulatory authorities through the establishment of an integrated data system among all regulatory bodies.  

(3) The institutionalization of digital governance must be implemented while ensuring access to diverse information systems; and quality public service must be guaranteed while protecting citizens’ rights through digital tools.  

(4) The establishment of governance should culminate in the elimination of all forms of corruption through a legal framework; thus, each public institution must be mandated to achieve operational quality while ensuring the principles of accountability, transparency, and efficiency.  

(5) The transparency of political parties’ finances must be guaranteed through regulated electoral management that ensures continuous and credible electoral processes. Political reforms must adapt to ensure a clean, unbiased, transparent, organized, and efficient electoral process.  

(6) The promotion of ethical conduct and integrity among all levels of government must be prioritized; effective training should foster moral and ethical development among public servants to restore overall governance while mandating environments where accountability and social responsibility are common place.  

(7) The objective of creating an inclusive governance structure must prioritize the identification, recognition, and eradication of marginalization in all fronts of governance; thus fostering a climate where all voices are represented.  

(8) Establishing a mechanism for monitoring and evaluating the delivery of public services must consider responsiveness to citizens’ grievances; external feedback mechanisms should enhance accountability throughout institutions.  

(9) The efficient operation of the planning and budgeting process must trigger effective project management at all government levels. Regular assessments and evaluations should be carried out to enhance the capacity of public services while ensuring effective implementation of projects.  

(10) Recognizing and keeping track of human rights must increase the accountability of the government to human rights conventions; coordination should elevate the nation’s commitment to human rights observance across sectors.  

(11) The quality of regulation should systematically reduce inefficiencies across jurisdictions while enhancing the transparency and credibility of regulatory frameworks.  

(12) Digital governance should be implemented to enhance public service delivery; involvement of citizens in governance processes should be built into structures planning directly for their participation.  
  
12.5 Key Initiatives  
(1) Strengthening national security and unity should involve updating relevant laws and regulations while ensuring operational standards for governmental institutions operate effectively in addressing demanding national matters.  

(2) Achieving better transparency standards in public administration through the deployment of information systems that allow better engagement and interoperability with national and provincial data systems.  

(3) Enhancing the implementation of electoral and political accountability mechanisms to ensure a transparent electoral process; systems should facilitate checks and balances among public authorities.  

(4) Maintaining focus on the constitutional objectives of good governance while cementing project management data across government levels through effective monitoring and evaluation systems.  

(5) Heightened engagement with international best practices should promote equitable economic developments structured around governance measures that balance monetary accountability. 

(6) Ensuring adequate resources and training for regulatory and administrative functions to professionalize governance and build capacity among public servants should remain a priority.  

(7) Initiatives driving good governance must engage all levels of authorities as well as citizens to create participatory budgets and ensure responsiveness to public needs.  

(8) Coordination between executive and legislative bodies must be improved through standardized communication and operational protocols that engage citizens.  

(9) Reporting mechanisms should link public services to public accountability by incentivizing transparency and the challenges that may inhibit effective governance strategies.  

(10) A comprehensive system that incorporates all levels of government is necessary to ensure that citizens’ needs are continuously met while enhancing rights recognition across all governance practices.  

(11) Assigning measurable outcomes to governmental actions will guide the planning and execution of strategic policy objectives that efficiently resonate with citizen welfare.  

(12) Continuous revisions of policies and operational procedures must keep standard practices that promote human rights observance, fostering environments built on transparency and accountability.   

(13) Creating robust legislative frameworks will entail audacious reforms leading to a fully integrated governance system that coordinates all efforts towards fostering good governance.  

(14) Digital governance reforms should infuse a culture of accountability among citizen bodies, where feedback mechanisms can translate into actionable policies that promote effective governance.
