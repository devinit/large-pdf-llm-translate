**Production, productivity, and competitive environment overview**

3.1 Background

To make the national economy independent, strong, and self-reliant, it is necessary to identify the sources of production available in the country and enhance production and productivity through effective utilization of these resources. It is vital to make all sectors of the economy dynamic and competitive, ensuring quality goods production and effective service delivery to improve the living standards of the general population. The production and productivity of agriculture, industry, energy, forests, tourism, education, and health sectors are critical for the economic development and prosperity of the country, which requires the efficient operation of capital, infrastructure, labor, and land resources.

Achieving productivity in the primary sector is essential through effective protection and other uses of agricultural land, improving the productivity of agriculture and livestock, and systematically managing industrial development and income generation to ensure a self-reliant economy. The service sector should develop as a quality, business-oriented, competitive, sustainable solution to make the economy dynamic. The products produced in the primary sector should be used as inputs in the secondary sector, with the primary and secondary sectors utilizing the outputs of the tertiary sector. Overall, the interdependence of the economic development sectors plays a crucial role in enhancing production, productivity, and competitiveness.

3.2 Current Situation

Nepal's national agricultural policy has traditionally focused on the use of sustainable land resources and the elimination of dual exploitation regarding long-term agricultural development. By 2100, the commercialization of the agricultural sector, along with the use of clean, renewable, and high-quality resources for industries and services, is expected to significantly contribute to production and productivity. In the 14th plan period, it has been estimated that the average contribution of the primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors to the economy will reach 24.1, 17.6, and 58.3 percent respectively. As of the fiscal year 2079/80, these contributions stand at 24.6, 13.0, and 62.4 percent respectively. 

The efforts made in the agricultural sector have resulted in a significant increase in the productivity of major agricultural crops, reaching an average of 3.42 metric tons per hectare by 2079/80. Among irrigable lands, around 25 percent has achieved full irrigation infrastructure. Currently, the trend of commercializing agriculture is increasing, with a focus on high-value crops, cash crops, and agricultural tourism. Despite the target yields not being met for key crops like paddy, wheat, millet, and maize, production continues to rise for fish, meat, eggs, and milk, indicating a movement towards self-reliance in the country's agricultural sectors. Essential commodities (agricultural products, livestock, and food items) accounted for a target contribution of 5 percent in the total income in the 14th plan, but this figure has reached 15 percent.

Within total agricultural production, the target contribution of the industrial sector was projected to be 6.5 percent in the 14th plan, whereas it reached 5.3 percent in the fiscal year 2079/80. For the growth of industrial development, necessary supply chain frameworks, the establishment and operation of industrial zones, and appropriate laws and regulations have been set up. The contribution of the tourism sector to total agricultural production is estimated at 2.0 percent, with around 2 million participants employed in this sector. This sector generated a foreign exchange income of $548.1 million in 2023. By the fiscal year 2079/80, the total contribution of hydropower and alternative energy sources to the national electrical system reached 2877 megawatts, while the distribution electricity stood at 380 megawatt-hours. A total of 15 million ha have been set aside to provide irrigation facilities.

3.3 Main Issues and Challenges

(1) Enhancing production, productivity, and competitive environment in agriculture: Improving the productive potential and agricultural infrastructure (roads, energy, and irrigation) while ensuring easy access to resources; maximizing the use of irrigation and fallow farmland; promoting crop diversification and eco-friendly practices while minimizing the usage in non-agricultural areas; adapting agricultural systems to climate change while establishing sustainable production systems; strengthening the supply chain for harvesting, processing, and marketing agricultural products; ensuring necessary infrastructure for research, innovation, and training in agricultural productivity; keeping the economic gains for everyone involved in the collective cooperative network; and ensuring sustainable agricultural practices.

(2) Contribution of the industrial sector to the economy's growth: Identifying products and services with competitive and comparative advantages; ensuring effective production for market supply; revitalizing sick industries and enabling existing businesses to function efficiently; dedicating local and international investments with a focus on industries’ development; developing necessary skills, entrepreneurship, risk management, and technical knowledge essential for industrial growth; incorporating traditional knowledge and skills and facilitating small, medium, and cottage industries’ development.

(3) Production and efficiency of the energy sector: Ensuring diversified and quality energy production; managing energy development effectively while enhancing both public and private sector investments; ensuring transmission and distribution systems are in place for growing domestic energy consumption; diversifying into new renewable energy sources; optimizing utilization of existing energy resources and stakeholder participation.

In summary, the document provides a comprehensive outline and strategy for improving overall productivity and competitiveness within various sectors, emphasizing agricultural innovation, industrial growth, and effective energy management that will ultimately contribute to Nepal's sustainable economic development.
