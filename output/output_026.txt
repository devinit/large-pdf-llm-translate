Easy Graduation and Sustainable Development Goals Implementation from Least Developed Countries  
14.1 Background  
Self-reliance, independence, progressive and prosperous economic development is crucial. By 2026, Nepal is expected to graduate from the group of least developed countries. The graduation will not only elevate the stature of Nepal and Nepalis but will also create new opportunities. However, there will be a need for effective utilization of these opportunities. Currently, Nepal faces a reduction and decrease in some aid and support from other countries. Hence, there is a need for strategic planning to effectively manage the impact of this reduction. The goal is to make the graduation irreversible and sustainable, enabling the country to transition to a high-middle-income nation by 2043 while focusing on domestic economic growth and sustainable development. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) accepted as a universal agenda outline the targets for Nepal. The implementation of the SDGs, which are fundamental to Nepal's long-term vision, is being systematically integrated and managed. 
The SDGs envision an end to poverty, zero hunger, good health, quality education, and other targets, but the COVID-19 pandemic, global economic downturn, climate change, and other disasters have negatively impacted progress toward these goals. Despite challenging conditions, effective implementation of the SDGs and associated initiatives must ensure continued progress.
14.2 Current State  
(a) Graduation from Least Developed Countries  
The indicators for graduation from least developed to developing countries are: (1) Gross National Income per Capita, (2) Human Asset Index (HAI), and (3) Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI). Nepal achieved the required minimum levels for two of these indicators (HAI and EVI) in 2015. Based on the assessment from 2015 and 2018, Nepal was eligible for graduation in 2021. The impacts of the 2015 devastating earthquake and subsequent natural calamities impacted the Gross National Income indicator, causing a delay in graduation. A recent valuation in 2021 has determined that Nepal is likely to graduate in 2026. The economic impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected both economic and social activities, postponing readiness by an additional two years, but the necessary preparations are underway. As per the assessments from 2015, 2018, 2021, and projections for 2024, the indicators related to graduation for developing nations as well as the status of Nepal in relation to that progress are outlined in Table 14.1.

Easy Graduation and Sustainable Development Goals Implementation from Least Developed Countries | 251 The expected impacts of graduation for Nepal include international development assistance management strategies, unified trade strategy for 2080 AD, and other integrated strategies for smooth transition from least developed to developing status. By the time of graduation in 2026, Nepal must align its Gross National Income with the graduation threshold, along with enhancements in the Human Asset Index and economic and environmental indicators. The necessary development plans should emphasize this alignment and progression.  
(b) Initial Steps towards Sustainable Development Goals  
Nepal has begun integrating the Sustainable Development Goals into its legal and institutional frameworks as per the country's economic, social, and environmental context. Hence, the budget and implementation of programs have been aligned with the SDGs. The SDGs have been localized through integration into medium-term plans, provincial and local plans. The entire government and community are working towards achieving the SDGs, ensuring cooperation among government, private sector, cooperatives, civil society, and development partners to meet these targets by 2030. An impactful assessment of resources and implementations strategy is in place to achieve the required SDG targets. By 2022, about 40% progress toward the 2030 goals has been achieved. The dimensions of all SDG indicators need to be articulated into the implementation process, including existing institutional arrangements to facilitate further advancements.  
14.3 Key Issues and Challenges  
(1) Gross National Income increase as an important factor: To ensure graduation, Nepal needs to scale up its Gross National Income in alignment with the Human Asset Index and economic and environmental vulnerability indicators.  
(2) Implementing comprehensive and effective measures: Considering the economic downturn and high inflation rates in light of the impact of COVID-19 and current international economic adversities, Nepal may struggle to achieve a rapid recovery. Graduation strategies must prioritize sustainable development, employment creation, equity, health, and education improvement. Comprehensive economic adjustment measures must account for the changing dynamics of macroeconomic factors.  
(3) Mitigating the impact on international trade: Achieving graduation from least developed countries during a time of unprecedented economic contraction demands advanced trade strategies, especially in ensuring that Nepal's products gain access to important markets, particularly in Europe, USA, China, Japan, Canada, Australia, and South Korea. Immediate steps must be taken to facilitate trade agreements with developed countries.  
(4) Managing the impacts of developmental assistance sources: Post-graduation, the availability of international development assistance may decline. More efforts are needed to secure funding from alternative developmental finance sources and appropriate identification of new strategic financing partnerships to navigate the transition.  
(5) Generating employment opportunities: Economic activity, international support, and development management impacts need to be evaluated regarding employment. The study of commodities and services with potential in trade must be pursued to stimulate further employment opportunities.  
(6) Availability of resources: Securing adequate resources for the attainment of SDGs remains a formidable challenge. Identifying and mobilizing additional resources through effective economic diplomacy is vital for successful implementation.  
(7) Localizing the SDGs: The local essence of the Sustainable Development Goals must be embraced, ensuring coordination among federal, provincial, and local governments and institutions while monitoring and evaluating the implementation at various administrative levels.  
(8) Fostering collaboration and partnerships: As the success of the Sustainable Development Goals relies on collective action from various stakeholders, facilitating partnerships and collaborations among government, NGOs, cooperatives, civil society, and private sectors is crucial for success.  
(9) Ensuring sustainable and robust systems of monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals is essential. Effective tracking of progress and sustaining committed efforts need to be achieved to adapt and identify the impact of policies and intended results.  
14.4 Transformative Strategies  
(1) Effective implementation of the smooth transition strategies: The post-graduation impact on trade, aid, and public assistance must be integrated as part of the strategic planning efforts.  
(2) Enhancing Gross National Income: Promoting entrepreneurship, employment generation, and income opportunities in high-income countries through mechanisms that can facilitate growth in Gross National Income should be a priority.  
(3) Establishing a stable economic system: Coordination among federal and provincial governments and financial management must undergo a significant emphasis on effective resource allocation to sustain overall development.  
(4) Addressing competitive markets: The anticipated impacts on Nepal's overall trade performance must highlight strengthening the product competitiveness and market strategies.  
(5) Engaging in trade negotiations and agreements: By 2026, implementing trade policies to establish opportunities for Nepalese commodities and services in international markets must be conducted.  
(6) Facilitating service export: As a landlocked nation, strategies must focus on exploring service trade avenues.  
(7) Strengthening intellectual property rights: Enforcement and enhancement of intellectual property rights must protect traditional and local knowledge, innovations, and creations.  
(8) Efficient management of development assistance: Fostering proactive management relationships with international agencies can help accrue further investments and support for developmental goals.  
(9) Integrating social inclusion and cohesion through governmental coordination towards the Sustainable Development Goals localization, ensuring equitable outreach within diverse communities.  
(10) Identifying and enhancing investment strategies: Targeting adequate funding and investment to create opportunities for job creation and resource utilization are essential for developing a conducive investment environment that supports development.  
(11) Promoting partnerships and coordination: Strengthening collaborative investments and partnerships will foster the successful implementation of Sustainable Development Goals.  
(12) Comprehensive monitoring and evaluation: Tracking implementation using specific benchmarks will ensure robust assessments of the SDG progress, encouraging corrective measures accordingly.
