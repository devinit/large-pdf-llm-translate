Chapter 8
Gender Equality, Social Justice and Inclusive Society  

8.1 Overview 
The constitution of Nepal envisages the establishment of a socially just, inclusive, and equitable society by addressing systemic discrimination on the basis of caste, ethnicity, gender, and economic status. It aims to create an inclusive society that promotes social equality through the empowerment of different marginalized communities, including Dalits, indigenous populations, minorities, and other disadvantaged groups, alongside ensuring the equal rights and protection of marginalized women and children. The constitution emphasizes the implementation of positive discrimination laws and policies aimed at achieving this vision.

The governance framework mandates the government’s commitment to protecting the rights of all individuals, upholding human rights, ensuring equal opportunities for education and social welfare across different demographics. It mandates that all actions aim to reduce inequalities in economic, social, and political spheres and enhance access to basic services and opportunities for all, thereby promoting inclusive development.

8.2 Current Status 
Legal and policy measures enacted to promote broader access to rights and social security benefits have resulted in significant achievements in terms of empowerment, inclusion, and social mobility among marginalized groups in society. Important policies and legal reforms addressing various forms of discrimination and violence against marginalized communities have been launched.

The enactment of laws such as the "Discrimination Act, 1979," which addresses all forms of discrimination, and the "Women Rights and Gender Equality Act, 2006," which focuses on women’s rights, represent significant milestones. Regulations permitting the inclusion of indigenous and marginalized communities in governance and development processes have also been formulated, reinforcing equity.

Furthermore, ongoing efforts and actions to ensure the rights of disabled individuals through the "Disability Rights Act, 2017" aim to integrate disabled citizens into the broader socio-economic framework. Programs targeting child rights, labor discrimination, and protecting the rights of elderly citizens have also been prioritized through policy reforms in recent years.

The nation has established institutional mechanisms at the federal, provincial, and local levels that enhance collaboration and participation from all citizens, including marginalized communities, to further their interests.

8.3 Key Issues and Challenges 
(1) Ending Discrimination and Societal Abuses: Address the social practices and norms that perpetuate discrimination against women, marginalized communities, and socially backward groups to end practices like dowry, child marriage, and caste-based discrimination. It is imperative to eradicate structural violence, discrimination, and exploitation entrenched in societal norms.
(2) Ending All Forms of Violence: Promote access to justice, support services, and psychological care for victims of violence, ensuring that all forms of domestic violence, including those against women and other marginalized genders, are recognized, addressed, and prevented effectively.
(3) Economic and Social Empowerment of Marginalized Communities: Ensure access to essential services like health, education, food, housing, and employment, aiming to bridge gaps in access to economic resources, opportunities, and services for marginalized communities.
(4) Protection of Identity and Rights of Marginalized Groups: Uphold the rights of marginalized groups through an inclusive governance framework that prioritizes their issues and concerns, facilitating appropriate representation in decision-making processes at all levels.
(5) Recognizing Contributions of Marginalized Individuals and Communities: Develop mechanisms to evaluate and recognize the contributions of marginalized communities to the economy, emphasizing their skill development and employment opportunities, while ensuring their rights and respect for their dignity.
(6) Focused Development for Marginalized Groups and Communities: Implement social safety nets and assistance programs that effectively support economically marginalized and socially vulnerable populations, ensuring they have access to necessary social, economic, and legal resources.
