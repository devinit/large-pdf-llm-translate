**Urban Planning, Development and Emerging Urbanization and Settlement Development**  
**Chapter 7**  

**7.1 Background**  
Urban planning, development, and emerging urbanization and settlement development help enhance the quality of urban life, production facilities, and productivity in development sectors. Therefore, effective and coordinated implementation of urban planning has been primarily emphasized in the national development strategy. Geographical, regional, and rural perspectives help improve production and productivity, fostering sustainable urbanization. In this context, the past plans concerning urban renewal and urban development initiatives provide us with insights, while the shifts in the developmental approach in urbanization have been systematically incorporated into Nepal's urban policy, strategy, and plans (such as sustainable urban development risk mitigation strategies, inclusive development goals, and the New Urban Agenda).

Due to the allure of services, infrastructure, and opportunities, Nepal is rapidly urbanizing. However, the accessibility of infrastructure and services in the urban areas of high mountains and hilly regions is being compromised due to a declining population in these areas. Urbanization has become unbalanced and multifaceted. As a result of the multi-faceted urban dynamics, it has been recognized that urban planning approaches have not adequately addressed the challenges of urban areas. Coordination and collaborative partnerships are crucial for effectively managing and planning urban systems, which require a holistic approach to strengthening urban systems promoting productivity and development. Experiences obtained from the implementation of federal governance, along with the need for planning for urban and rural integration, bring forth a necessity for coordinated management.

**7.2 Current Situation**  
According to the National Census 2078, the population residing in municipalities is 66.02 percent, while urban population classification reports indicate that urban population constitutes 27.07 percent in Nepal. Approximately 40 percent of the population is living in suburban areas, demonstrating an increased aspiration for urbanization. Despite the expectation of urbanization, the significant gap in urban services and facilities still prevails. 

Overall, there is a huge disparity in infrastructure and amenities within municipalities. According to the National Urban Strategy, 2073, there exists a significant gap in urban infrastructure indicators (e.g., Kathmandu Metropolitan City at 0.91 and Gulariya Municipality at 0.16). The average urban road density in the old 58 municipalities stands at 3.26 km per sq km, while the average road density in all municipalities is considerably lower than that. The urban areas such as Kathmandu and Lalitpur show a significant lack of essential public infrastructure.

Urban planners and developers need to consider the growing pressures on urban systems and the varying availability of urban infrastructure. There is still considerable difficulty in accessing services, working production facilities, and better living conditions in urban areas. 

Future urban development efforts must focus not only on physical infrastructure but also on integrating socio-cultural aspects, sustainable management, and fostering community engagement to achieve effective urban governance and planning coherence is vital.

**7.3 Major Issues and Challenges**  
- **Inequality in Urbanization:** The urban system should be integrated through process-oriented approaches addressing rural-urban integration and sustainable governance. There is a dire need for establishing prominent urban centers in regions to improve the urban economic systems.
  
- **Coordination and Urban Governance:** Enhancing the engagement of national, provincial, and local stakeholders is essential to strengthen urban service delivery while effectively managing urban coordination systems and governance structures.
  
- **Investment Management and Planning:** There is still a need for innovative financing options for urban development projects, enabling partnerships with the private sector, joint ventures and leveraging varied investment mechanisms.
  
- **Environmental Considerations:** Addressing environmental challenges in urban areas is critical for sustainable development, hence implementing effective infrastructural and regulatory measures must be prioritized to mitigate adverse climatic impacts.

**7.4 Transformational Strategies**  
The purpose of these strategies is to strengthen urban systems at national and provincial levels through consistent policy measures and governance structures that can efficiently allocate resources, improve service accessibility, and facilitate inclusively designed urban spaces accommodating diverse populations and their needs.

Overall, these strategies demand a concerted effort from government agencies, stakeholders, and communities to ensure that urbanization in Nepal does not just flourish but does so in an equitable, efficient and sustainable manner, using innovative practices to bridge gaps in existing systems.
